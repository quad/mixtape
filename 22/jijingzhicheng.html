			<h2> 寂静之 </h2>

			<blockquote>
				And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more.
				People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening.
				People writing songs that voices never shared, no one dared disturb the sound of silence.
			</blockquote>

			<p> 美利坚合众国，2015年，纽约。 </p>

			<p> 当电话响起来的时候，阿瓦登正趴在电脑前面睡觉。电话铃声十分急促，尖锐，每一次振动都让他的耳膜难受好久。他揉了揉干涩的眼睛，十分不情愿地爬起来，觉得脑子沉滞无比。 </p>

			<p> 其实他的脑子一直就很沉滞，这种感受既然是生理上的也是心理上的。他身处的房间很狭窄，空气不很好，唯一的两扇窗户紧闭着--即使打开窗户也没用，外面的空气更加浑浊。这是一间大约只有三十平米的小屋子，屋子墙壁上泛黄的墙纸有好几处开始剥落，天花板上的水渍渗成奇怪的形状；一张老式的军绿色行军床摆在墙角，床腿用白漆写着编号；紧挨着行军床的是一张三合板制成的电脑桌，桌上摆着一台浅白色的电脑，机箱后面五颜六色的电线纠缠在一起，把它们自己打成一个古怪的死结，杂乱无章地蔓延到地板与墙角，仿佛常春藤一样。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登走到电话前，慢慢坐到地板上，目光呆滞地盯着电话，手却没有动。这部古怪的东西是老式的按键式电话，大概是十几年前的款式，这是阿瓦登有一次去费城出差时偶尔在一家杂货店里买到的；他拿回家以后稍微修理了一下，发现居然还能用，这让他当时小小地兴奋了一阵子。 </p>

			<p> 电话继续在响着，已经是第七声。阿瓦登意识到自己不得不去接听了。于是他弓下腰，用两个指头拈起电话，慢慢把电话放到耳边。 </p>

			<p> "请说出你的网络编号？"话筒里传来的声音并不急噪，事实上它也不带其他任何的感情色彩，因为这是电脑合成的人工智能语音系统。 </p>

			<p> "19842015" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登熟练地报出一连串数字，同时开始觉得胸有些更闷了。说实话他并不喜欢这些空洞的电子声音，他有时候想，假如打过电话来的是一位声音圆润的女性该多好。阿瓦登知道这是一种不切实际的幻想，不过这幻想会让他的身体得到几秒钟的舒缓。 </p>

			<p> 话筒里的声音仍旧在继续着。 </p>

			<p> "关于你在十月四日提交的网络论坛用户注册申请已经被受理，经有关部门审查后确认资格无误，请在三日内持本人身份证件、网络使用许可证及相关文件前往办理登记手续，并领取用户名及密码。" </p>

			<p> "知道了，谢谢。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登谨慎地选择词语，同时努力挤出一副满足的微笑，好象话筒的另一侧有人在看着自己一样。放下电话，阿瓦登先是茫然地盯着它看了大约两分钟，然后站起来活动一下手腕，坐回到电脑前面，缓慢地推动了一下鼠标。 </p>

			<p> 电脑屏幕"啪"地一声亮了起来，显示出一个登陆的界面，还有一行英文："请输入你的网络编号和姓名。"阿瓦登将那八位数字敲进去，又输入了自己的名字，点击"登陆"。随即机箱的指示灯开始频繁地闪动起来，整个机器发出细微的噪音。 </p>

			<p> 每一个使用互联网的人都有一个网络编号，没有这个编号，就无法连接进互联网络。每一个编号都是独一无二的，每个人只有一个；这是使用者在网上的唯一代号，既不能修改，也不能取消。这些编号分别对应着使用者身份证上的名字，因此19842015就是阿瓦登，阿瓦登就是19842015。阿瓦登知道有些记忆力不好的人会把自己的编号印在衣服的后面，那看起来颇为滑稽，也容易引发一些不正当的联想。 </p>

			<p> 有关部门说使用网络实名制是为了规范网络秩序方便管理，杜绝因匿名使用网络而产生的一系列重大问题和混乱。阿瓦登不太清楚那一系列重大问题会是什么，他自己没试过用假名上网，他所认识的任何人里也不曾有人尝试过--事实上，从技术角度来说，他根本没办法匿名登陆互联网络，没有编号就没有权限上网，而编号则连接着他的详细档案，换句话说，没人能在网上隐藏自己。有关部门把这一切都考虑的很周详。 </p>

			<p> "有关部门"，这是一个语意模糊、但却有着权威与震慑力的词组。它既是泛指，又是确指，其所涵盖的意义相当广泛。有时候，它指的是为阿瓦登颁发网络编号的美国联邦网络管理委员会；有时候它是将最新通告及法规发到阿瓦登EMAIL信箱的服务器；还有时候它是监察网络的FBI特属网络调查科；总之一句话，有关部门是无处不在，无职不司的，总会在适当的时候出现，给予指导、监控或者警告，无论你是在网上还是网下。 </p>

			<p> 简直就象是老大哥一样无微不至。 </p>

			<p> 电脑仍旧在持续运转着，阿瓦登知道这得花上一阵子。这台电脑是有关部门配发给他的，具体型号和配置阿瓦登并不清楚，机箱是被焊死的，无法打开。于是他拿出一小瓶清凉油，用右手小拇指的指甲挑出一点抹在自己的太阳穴，然后从脚下堆积如山的杂物里翻出一个塑料杯子，从桌子旁的饮水机里接了半杯蒸馏水，就着一片镇痛片一饮而尽。蒸馏水穿过喉咙和狭长的食道滑进胃里，空泛的味道让他有些恶心。 </p>

			<p> 音响里忽然传来一阵美国国歌的旋律，阿瓦登放下杯子，重新把目光投到电脑上去。这是已经连入互联网络的标志。屏幕上首先跳出来的是有关部门的通告，白底黑色四号字，里面陈述了使用互联网的意义以及最新的规章制度。 </p>

			<p> "缔造健康的互联网络，美国万岁！" </p>

			<p> 音响里传来激昂的男性呼声，阿瓦登不大情愿地跟着大声念了一遍。"缔造健康的互联网络，美国万岁！" </p>

			<p> 这段呼号持续了三十秒钟，然后消失，取而代之的是写着"缔造健康的互联网络"标语的桌面背景。另外一个窗口慢慢浮上开，上面开列出几个选项：工作、娱乐、电子信箱和BBS论坛。其中BBS选项呈现灰色，说明这项功能还没有开通。 </p>

			<p> 整个操作系统简洁明了，这台电脑的浏览器没有地址输入栏，只是在收藏夹里有几个无法修改的的网站地址。理由很简单，这些网站都是健康向上的，假如其他站点和这些网站一样，那么只保留这些网站就够了；假如其他站点与这些网站不一样，那么就是不健康的，是低级趣味，不能保留。这是有关部门精心设计的，是为了公民的精神健康着想，生怕他们受到不良信息的侵染。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登首先点开了"工作"，一连串和他工作相关的站点列表与相关软件在电脑上显示出来。阿瓦登是一名程序员，他每天的工作就是根据上级的要求编写程序。这份工作很无聊，不过可以保证他有稳定的收入。他不知道自己的源代码会被用到哪里去，上级也从来没有跟他说过。 </p>

			<p> 他打算继续昨天的工作，但是很快发现自己很难继续下去。阿瓦登觉得今天的情绪比以前要烦躁，无法集中精神，大脑还是很呆滞，胸口仍旧发闷。他试图娱乐自己，但是他发现"娱乐"选项里只有纸牌与挖地雷，根据有关部门的说法，这是两个健康的游戏，没有暴力，没有色情，不会让人产生犯罪冲动，也不涉及任何政治色彩。据说美国境外也是有互联网络站点的，不过无法连上去，因为本国的互联网络自成格局，独立自主，普通人无法直接连接到国外--IE浏览器没有地址栏，就算知道地址也没有用处。 </p>

			<p> "您有一封新邮件。" </p>

			<p> 系统忽然跳出来提示，阿瓦登终于找到了可以暂停工作的理由，他很快移动鼠标到电子信箱的选项上，点开，很快一个新的界面出现了。 </p>

			<p> "To: 19842015 </p>

			<p> From：10045687 </p>

			Subject: 模块、已经、完成、当前、项目、是否、开始。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登微微地叹了一口气，觉得有些失望。每一次他收到新的电子邮件，都希望能够有一次新鲜的刺激来撞击他日益迟钝的脑神经，每一次他都失望了。其实他早就知道这一点，只不过他觉得保持期待至少能够享受到几秒钟快感。就好象他期待着打电话过来的是一个圆润温柔的女性声音一样。不给自己一些渺茫的希望，阿瓦登觉得自己迟早会疯掉的。 </p>

			<p> 这封信很简短，但是内容很充实。19842015是阿瓦登的网络编号，而10045687则是他的一位同事的编号，这种工作性质的信件通常都以编号相称。信的内容是几个不连续的英文单词，这是有关部门所提倡的一种电子邮件书写方式，因为这样可以方便软件检查信件中是否含有敏感词汇。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登打开回信的页面，同时另开了一个窗口，打开一份名字叫做"网络健康语言词汇列表"的TXT文档。这是有关部门要求每一位网民所必须使用的词汇。当他们书写电子邮件或者使用论坛服务的时候，都得从这个词汇列表中寻找适合的名词、形容词、副词或者动词来表达自己想要说的话。一旦过滤软件发现网民使用了列表以外的词，那么这个词就会被自动屏蔽，取而代之的是"请使用健康语言"。 </p>

			<p> "屏蔽"是个专有名词，被屏蔽的词将不允许再度被使用，无论是在书信里还是口头都不允许。讽刺的是，"屏蔽"一词本身也是被屏蔽的词汇之一。 </p>

			<p> 这个列表是经常更新的，每一次更新都会有几个词在列表上消失，于是阿瓦登不得不费劲脑汁寻找其他词语来代替那个被屏蔽掉的词语或者单字。比如在以前，"运动"这个词是可以使用的，但后来有关部门宣布这也是一个敏感词汇，阿瓦登只好使用"质点位移"来表达相同的意思。 </p>

			<p> 他对照着这份列表，很快就完成了一封文字风格与来信差不多的EMAIL--健康词汇表迫使人们不得不用最短的话来表达最多意思，而且要尽量减少不必要的修辞，所以这些信件就好象是那杯蒸馏水一样，淡而无味，阿瓦登有时候想，他早晚也会和这些水和信一样腐烂，因为这些信是他写的，水是他喝的。 </p>

			<p> 接下来阿瓦登启动检查软件先扫了一遍，确保自己没无意中加入什么敏感词汇。等这一切都完成后，他按下了发送键，邮件被送出去了。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登没有留下备份，因为他的机器里没有硬盘，也没有软驱、光驱或者USB接口。这个时代宽带技术已经得到了很大发展，应用软件可以集中在统一的一个服务器中，个人用户调用时的速度丝毫不会觉得迟滞。因此个人不需要硬盘，也不需要本地存储，他们在自己电脑里写的每一份文档、每一段程序、甚至每一个动作都会被自动传送到有关部门的公共服务器中，这样便于管理。换句话说，阿瓦登所使用的电脑，仅仅具备输入和输出两种功能。 </p>

			<p> 完成了这封信后，阿瓦登再度陷入了软绵绵的焦躁状态，这是一个连续工作了三天的程序员的正常反应。这种情绪很危险，因为它让人效率低下精神低迷，而且没有渠道发泄。"疲劳"、"烦躁"以及其他负面词汇都属于危险词汇，如果他写信给别人抱怨的话，那么对方收到的将会是一封写满"请使用健康语言"的EMAIL。 </p>

			<p> 这就是阿瓦登每天的生活，今天比昨天更糟糕，但应该比明天还稍微好一点。事实上这个叙述也很模糊，因为阿瓦登自己并不清楚什么是"好一点"，什么是"更糟糕"。"好"与"坏"是两个变量，而他的生活就是一个定量，只有一个常数叫"压抑"。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登推开鼠标，把脑袋向后仰去，长长地呼了一口气。（至少"呼"这个字还没有被屏蔽）这是空虚的表现，他想哼些歌，但却又不记得什么，转而吹了几下口哨，但那听起来与一只生了肺结核的狗差不多，只得做罢。有关部门象幽灵一样充斥在整个房间里，让他无法舒展自己的烦闷。就好象一个人在泥沼里挣扎，刚一张口就被灌入泥水，甚至无法大声呼救。 </p>

			<p> 他的头不安分地转了几转，眼神偶尔撇到了摆在地板上的老式电话机，他忽然想到还必须要去有关部门申请自己的BBS论坛浏览许可证。于是他关掉"工作"和"电子邮件"窗口，退出了网络登陆。阿瓦登在做这些事的时候毫不犹豫，他很高兴能够暂时摆脱互联网络，在那上面他只是一串枯燥的数字和一些"健康词汇"的综合体。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登找出一件破旧的黑色呢子大衣，那件大衣继承自他的父亲，袖口和领子已经磨损的很严重，个别地方有灰色的棉花露出来，但还是很耐寒。他把大衣套到身上，戴上一副墨绿色的护镜，用过滤口罩捂住嘴。他犹豫了一下，拿起"旁听者"别在耳朵上，然后走出家门去。 </p>

			<p> 纽约的街上人很少，在这个时代，互联网的普及率相当地高，大部分事务在网上就可以解决，有关部门并不提倡太多的户外活动。太多的户外活动会导致和其他人发生物理接触，而两个人发生物理接触后会发生什么事则很难控制。 </p>

			<p> "旁听者"就是为了防止这种事而发生的，这是一种便携式的语言过滤器，当携带者说出敏感词汇的时候，它就会自动发出警报。每一位公民外出前都必须要携带这个装置，以便随时检讨自己的言语。当人们意识到旁听者存在的时候，他们往往会选择沉默，至少阿瓦登是如此。有关部门正逐步试图让网络和现实生活统一起来，一起"健康"。 </p>

			<p> 这时候正是11月份，寒风凛冽，天空漂浮着令人压抑的铅灰阴云，街道两旁的电线杆仿佛落光了叶子的枯树，行人们都把自己包裹在黑色或灰色的大衣里面，浓缩成空旷街道上的一个个黑点飞快移动着。一层若有若无的烟雾将整个纽约笼罩起来，不用过滤口罩在这样的空气里呼吸将会是一件很有挑战的事情。 </p>

			<p> 距离上一次离开家门已经有两个月了吧，阿瓦登站在公共汽车站的站牌下，不无感慨地想，周围的一切看起来很陌生，泛黄，而且干燥。那是上一次沙尘暴的痕迹。不过沙尘暴这个词也已经被屏蔽了，因此阿瓦登的脑海里只是闪过那么一下，思想很快就转移到别的事情上去了。 </p>

			<p> 站在阿瓦登旁边的是一个穿着蓝色制服的高个男人。他先是狐疑地看了阿瓦登一眼，看到后者沉默地沉在黑色大衣里，他的两只脚交替移动，缓慢地凑了过去，装做漫不经心对阿瓦登说： </p>

			<p> "烟，有吗？" </p>

			<p> 男人说，每一个字都说的很清晰，而且词与词之间间隔也足够长。这"旁听者"还没有精密到能够完全捕捉到每一个人语速和语调的程度，因此有关部门要求每一位公民都要保持这种说话风格，以方面检测发言人是否使用了规定以外的词汇。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登转过头去，看了他一眼，舔舔自己干裂的嘴唇，回答说： </p>

			<p> "没有。" </p>

			<p> 男人很失望，又一次不甘心地张开嘴。 </p>

			<p> "酒，有吗？" </p>

			<p> "没有。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登又重复了一次这个词，他也已经很久没有收到烟和酒了，也许是缺货的关系吧，这是常有的事。不过有一点很奇怪，"旁观者"这一次却没有发出警报。以阿瓦登的经验，以往一旦烟、酒或者其他生活必需品发生短缺现象，这个词就会暂时成为被屏蔽掉的敏感词汇，直到恢复供给为止。 </p>

			<p> 这个男人看起来很疲惫，红肿的眼睛是这个时代的人们普遍的特征，这是长时间挂在网上的关系。他的头发蓬乱，嘴边还留着青色的胡子碴，制服下的衬衣领口散发着刺鼻的霉味。能看的出，他也很久不曾到街上来了。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登这时候才注意到，他的耳朵上空荡荡的，没有挂着那个银灰色的小玩意"旁听者"，这实在是一件严重的事情。不携带"旁听者"外出，就意味着语言不会再被过滤，一些不健康的思想和言论就有可能孳生，因此有关部门相当严厉地规定公民上街必须携带旁听者。而这个男人的耳朵旁却什么也没有。阿瓦登暗暗吃惊，一时间不知道是该去提醒还是装做没看到。他暗自想，也许向有关部门举报会更好。 </p>

			<p> 这时候那个男人又朝他靠近了一点，眼神变的饥渴起来。阿瓦登心里一阵紧张，下意识地向后退去。这难道是一次抢劫？还是说他是个压抑太久的同性恋者？那个男人忽然扯住他的袖子，阿瓦登狼狈地挣扎却没有挣开。出乎他的意料，那个男人并没有进一步的动作，而是大吼一声，用一种阿瓦登已经不太习惯了的飞快语速向他倾泻起话语来。阿瓦登被这突如其来的爆发弄的莫名其妙，不知所措。 </p>

			<p> "我只是想和你多几句话，就几句，我很久没有说过话了。我叫斯多葛，今年三十二岁，记得，是三十二岁。我一直梦想有一套在湖边的房子，有一副钓鱼竿和一条小艇；我讨厌网络，打倒网管；我妻子是个可恶的网络中毒者，她只会用枯燥乏味的话叫我的网络编号；这个城市就是一个大疯人院，里面大疯子管着小疯子，并且把所有没疯的人变的和他们同样疯狂；敏感词汇都去他X的，老*受够了..." </p>

			<p> 男人的话仿佛一瓶摇晃了很久然后突然打开的罐装碳酸饮料，迅猛，爆裂，而且全无条理。阿瓦登惊愕地望着这个突然狂躁起来的家伙，却不知道如何应对；更可怕的是，他发现自己居然对他产生了一点同情，那种"同病相怜"式的同情。男人的话这时候已经从唠叨变成了纯粹谩骂，全部都是最直抒胸臆的那种。阿瓦登已经有五、六年不曾说过这些脏话，最后一次听到这些也是四年前。有关部门认为这都有碍精神文明，于是全部都屏蔽掉了。 </p>

			<p> 而现在这个男人就在公众场合对着他大吵大嚷，似乎要将被屏蔽掉的敏感词汇一口气全倒出来。他的目光和手势并不针对任何人，甚至也不针对阿瓦登，更象是在一个人在自说自话。阿瓦登的耳膜似乎不习惯这种分贝，开始有些隐隐做痛，他捂着耳朵，拿不定主意是干脆逃掉还是...这时候，远处街道出现两辆警车，一路闪着警灯直直冲着这座公共汽车站而来。 </p>

			<p> 警车开到站台旁时，男人仍旧在痛骂着。警车门开了，涌出了五、六名全副武装的联邦警察。他们扑过去将那个男子按在地上，用橡皮棍痛打。男人两条腿挣扎着，嘴里的语速更快了，骂出来的话也越来越难听。其中一名警察掏出一卷胶带，"嚓"地一声扯下一条向男人的嘴贴去。男人在嘴被胶带封住之前，突然提高嗓门，冲着警察痛快无比地喊了一句："FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH！"阿瓦登看到他的表情由疯狂变成享受，面带着微笑，似乎完全陶醉在那一句话所带来的无上快感和解脱感中。 </p>

			<p> 联邦警察们七手八脚地将男人送进了警车，这时才有一名警察走到了阿瓦登的跟前。 </p>

			<p> "他，是，你朋友？" </p>

			<p> "我，不，认识。" </p>

			<p> 警察盯了他一阵，取下他耳朵上的"旁观者"查看记录，发现他并没有提及任何敏感词汇，于是重新给他戴回去，警告他说那名男子说的全部都是极度反动的词汇，要求他立刻忘掉，然后转身押着那男子离开了。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登松了一口气，其实刚才他有一瞬间涌现出一种冲动，也想在这空旷的街道上大喊一声"FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH"那一定很爽快，他心里想，因为那男子说出这句话的时候表情很享受。不过他也知道，这也是妄想的一种，"旁观者"紧帖在耳朵上的冰凉感觉时刻提醒着他。 </p>

			<p> 街上很快就恢复了冷清，十分钟后，一辆公共汽车慢吞吞地开进站里，锈迹斑斑的车门哗啦一声打开，一个电子女声响彻整个空荡荡的车厢："请乘客注意文明用语，严格按照健康词汇发言。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登把自己缩进大衣，压抑住自己异样的兴奋，决定继续保持沉默下去。 </p>

			<p> 大约过了一个小时，公共汽车到了目的地。从破碎的车窗玻璃里吹进来的寒风让阿瓦登脸上挂起一层暗灰色的霜气，面部被风中的沙砾和煤渣刮的生疼。他听到电子女声报出了站名，就站起身来，象一条狗一样抖抖身上的土，走下车去。 </p>

			<p> 车站对面就是阿瓦登要去的地方，那是有关部门负责受理BBS论坛申请的网络部。这是一间五层的大楼，正方形，全水泥混凝土结构，外表泛灰。如果没有那几个窗户的话，那么它的外貌将与水泥块没有任何区别：生硬、死气沉沉，让蚊子和蝙蝠都退避三舍。 </p>

			<p> BBS论坛是一种奇特的东西，从理论上来讲它完全多余，BBS的功能完全可以由EMAIL新闻组来取代，后者更容易管理和审查。而且申请使用BBS论坛资格不是件容易的事，申请人必须要通过十几道手续和漫长的审查才能有浏览资格，浏览资格三个月才会被允许在指定论坛发布帖子，至于自己开设BBS则几乎是不可能。 </p>

			<p> 因此真正对BBS有兴趣的人少之有少。阿瓦登当初之所以决定申请BBS论坛资格，纯粹是因为他那种模糊但却顽强的怀旧心态，就好象他从杂货店里买的那部老式电话一样。他也不知道自己为什么会自找麻烦，也许是为了给生活带来些刺激，还是说为了强调自己和曾经旧时代的那么一点点联系，也许两者兼有之。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登恍惚记得在他小的时候，互联网与现在并不太一样。并不是指技术上的不同，而是一种人文的感觉。他希望能通过使用BBS论坛回想起一些当年的事情。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登走进网络部的大楼，大楼里和外面一样寒冷，而且阴森。走廊里没有路灯，蓝白色调的两侧墙壁贴满了千篇一律的网络规章条文与标语，冰冷的空气呼吸到肺里，让阿瓦登一阵痉挛。只有走廊尽头的小门缝隙里流泻出一丝光亮，小门的上面挂着一块牌子，上面写的是"网络部BBS论坛科。" </p>

			<p> 一走进这间屋子，阿瓦登立刻感觉到一阵温洋洋的热气。屋子里的暖气（或者是空调）开的很大，让阿瓦登冻麻了的手脚和脸麻酥酥的，有些发痒，他不禁想伸出手去挠挠。 </p>

			<p> "公民，请您站在原地不要动。" </p>

			<p> 一个电子女声忽然从天花板上的喇叭里传来，阿瓦登触电似地把手放下，恭敬地站在原地不同。他借这个机会观察了一下这间屋子。这屋子准确来说应该是一个狭长形的大厅，一道拔地而起的大理石柜台象长城一样将房间割裂成两部分，柜台上还装着一排银白色的圆柱形栅栏，直接连到天花板。屋子里没有任何装饰，没有观赏植物，没有塑料鲜花，甚至没有长椅和饮水机。 </p>

			<p> "缔造健康的互联网络，美国万岁。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登跟着声音重复了一遍。 </p>

			<p> "请前往八号窗口。" </p>

			<p> 电子女声的语调很流畅，因为这是电脑制作出来的，因此没有敏感词汇的限制。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登转头看到在自己右手边的不远处，大理石柜台上的液晶屏幕显示着八号的字样。他走过去，拼命抬起头，因为柜台实在太高了，他只能勉强看到边缘，而无法看到柜台另一侧的情形。不过他能听到，一个人走到柜台对面，坐下去，并有翻动纸张与敲击键盘的声音。 </p>

			<p> "请把文件放入盒子里。" </p>

			<p> 柜台上的喇叭传来命令。出乎意料，这一次在喇叭里的声音却变了。虽然同样冷漠枯燥，但阿瓦登还是能分辨出它与电子女声的不同--这是一个真正的女性的声音。他惊讶地抬头望去，却什么都看不到，柜台太高了。 </p>

			<p> "请把文件放入盒子里。" </p>

			<p> 声音又重复了一次，语气里带着一丝烦躁，似乎对阿瓦登的迟钝很不满。 </p>

			<p> "是的，这是真正的女声..."阿瓦登想，电子女声永远是彬彬有礼不带任何感情色彩的。他把相关的电子身份证、网络许可证、网络编号和敏感词汇犯罪记录等一系列个人资料卡片一起放进柜台外的一个小金属盒子里，然后把盒子插进柜台上一个同样大小的凹槽中，关好门。很快他听到"唰"的一声，他猜测这也许是对面的人--也许是个女人--将盒子抽出去的声音。 </p>

			<p> "你申请BBS服务的目的是什么？" </p>

			<p> 喇叭后的女声浸满了纯粹事务性的腔调。 </p>

			<p> "为了、提高、互联网络、工作效率、为了、缔造、一个、健康、的网络、环境，更好地、为、祖国、做出、贡献。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登一字一句地回答，心里知道这只是一道官方程序，只需要按标准回答就可以。 </p>

			<p> 对面很快就陷入沉默，大约过了十五分钟，喇叭再度响起。 </p>

			<p> "最后手续确认，你已经获得BBS论坛浏览权。" </p>

			<p> "谢谢。" </p>

			<p> "砰"的一声，金属盒子从柜子里弹了出来，里面除了阿瓦登的证件以外还多了五张小尺寸光盘。 </p>

			<p> "这是有关部门核发给你的BBS论坛统一用户名与密码，BBS论坛列表、互联网BBS论坛使用指南及相应法规、以及最新健康网络词汇列表。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登向前踏了一步，从盒子里将这些东西一股脑全拿出来，揣进大衣的大兜里。那些东西其实是可以全部放在同一张光盘里的，不过有关部门认为每一张光盘装一份文件有助于用户理解这些文件的严肃性和重要性，并产生敬畏。 </p>

			<p> 他心里盼望着那个喇叭能再说两句。让他失望的是，对面传来的是一个人起身并且离开的声音，从脚步声的韵律判断，阿瓦登愈发相信这是一名女性。 </p>

			<p> "手续办理完毕，请离开网络部回到自己的工作岗位上。" </p>

			<p> 甜美空洞的电子女声从天花板上传来，阿瓦登厌恶地抽动鼻翼，拿手揉了揉，转身离开这间温暖的大厅，重新进入到寒冷的走廊。 </p>

			<p> 在回家的路上，阿瓦登蜷缩在公共汽车上一动不动，顺利申请到BBS的使用权让他有些虚无缥缈的兴奋。他闭着眼睛，找了一个合适的角度躲开破窗而入的寒风，右手在兜里不断摩挲那一系列光盘，还在怀念着那一个神秘的女声。 </p>

			<p> 如果能再一次听到该多好，他不能抑制自己这样的想法，同时用拇指的指肚在光盘上轻轻地摩擦，幻想这几张光盘也曾经被她的手触摸过。他兴奋的几乎也想破口大骂一句"FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH"，真奇怪，那名男子的骂声在他的记忆里根深蒂固，并时不时不自觉地滑到唇边。 </p>

			<p> 忽然，他的手指在光盘上发觉到一丝异常的感觉。阿瓦登下意识地朝四周望去，确认周围一个乘客也没有后，他小心翼翼地把光盘全拿出来，就着窗外的光亮仔细端详。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登很快注意到，在装有BBS论坛列表的光盘背面，被人用指甲轻轻地划了一道刮痕。这条刮痕很轻，如果不是阿瓦登仔细地抚摩光盘的话，是很难发觉到的。这条刮痕很奇特，是一条直线，而在这条直线末端的不远处，则是另外一条极短的刮痕，似乎刻意想弯成一个圆点。整体看上去就好象是一个叹号，或者倒过来说，象是字母i。 </p>

			<p> 很快他在其他四张光盘上也发现了类似的刮痕，它们造型都不同，但都似乎代表着某种符号。阿瓦登回想起喇叭里那个女声最后一句提到过的文件顺序，于是把这五张光盘按照BBS论坛统一用户名与密码、BBS论坛列表、互联网BBS论坛使用指南、相应法规、以及最新健康网络词汇列表的顺序排列好，接着依次把那五道刮痕用手指临摹到汽车窗户上。很快那些刮痕构成了一个英文单词： </p>

			<p> title </p>

			<p> 题目？这是什么意思？ </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登看着这个单词莫名其妙，这究竟是纯属无意的痕迹，还是有人刻意为之？如果是有人刻意为之，他这么做的用意是什么？ </p>

			<p> 这时候汽车停住了，又有几名乘客走上车来。阿瓦登挪动一下身体，不让他们看到自己在车窗上写出来的字迹，然后装做打呵欠的样子抬起袖子，轻轻把那五个字母擦掉。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登暗自庆幸，如果他没有在现在发现这些光盘上的痕迹，那么以后就永远没有机会发觉了。按照规定，个人电脑是不允许使用任何存储存设备的，因此阿瓦登的电脑并没有光驱。他下一步所要做的是将这些光盘送交到管区网络安全部，由他们将光盘内资料登陆到服务器中，再转发给阿瓦登。这是为了防止个人私自在家里制造、阅读或者传播黄色或者反动信息，网络安全部发出的通告是这么解释的。联邦的网络警察经常会突入到个人家中进行临时检查，看用户是否非法拥有信息贮存设备，阿瓦登曾经亲眼见过一个邻居被警察带走，原因仅仅是因为他私自藏了一张光盘在家里--其实他只是打算拿那个当茶杯垫用。那个邻居再没回来过。 </p>

			<p> 无论这些符号代表的是什么意思，它都是一种全新的体验，这让阿瓦登感觉到兴奋。怀旧与渴望新奇是阿瓦登生活在这个时代的两根精神支柱，否则他会与这座城市一样变的僵硬，然后窒息而死。 </p>

			<p> 他先来到网络安全分部，将光盘交给那里的负责人，负责人反复地检查光盘和阿瓦登的表情，好象所有使用BBS论坛的人都不可信赖一样。末了负责人终于找不到什么破绽，只得将光盘收下，然后举起右手，阿瓦登和他一起高呼"缔造健康的互联网络"。这句话是唯一被允许可以连贯着被说出来的句子。 </p>

			<p> 回到家里，阿瓦登脱掉大衣，摘了过滤口罩，将旁观者扔到了行军床上，然后整个人也倒进枕头里。每次出去外面都会让他疲劳，这一半是因为他孱弱的肉体已经不大适合室外活动；另外一半原因是因为他必须花费大量的精力来应付旁观者。 </p>

			<p> 过了四十分钟，他才悠悠地醒过来，头还是和平常一样地疼，胸口还是一如既往地闷。胡乱吃了一点东西以后，阿瓦登爬到电脑桌前，打开电脑，按程序登陆上网络，习惯性地先检查了一遍信箱。 </p>

			<p> 信箱里有七、八封新的信件，其中两封是同事发来的事务信。另外五封则是网络安全部发给他的，内容就是他送交的那几张光盘。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登打开了包含有BBS论坛的用户名、密码和BBS论坛列表的两封信。他看到自己的论坛通用用户名叫做19842015，和自己的网络编号完全一样，不由得有些失望。他依稀记得在小的时候，BBS论坛的用户名是可以自己决定的，而且每一个论坛都可以不同，一个人在网上并不单只是一串枯燥数字。 </p>

			<p> 小时候的记忆往往是跟童话和幻想混杂在一起，未必与实际相符。现实中你只能使用有关部门指定的用户名和密码，理由很简单，用户名和密码内也可能含有敏感词汇。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登又打开了那份BBS列表，全部都是有关部门开设的官方论坛，没有私人的--事实上个人能够合法持有的电脑设备从技术上来说也无法架设新BBS--这些论坛的主题各有侧重点不同，但基本上是围绕着如何更好响应国家号召，缔造健康互联网络来说的。比如其中一个电脑技术论坛，主题就是如何更好地屏蔽掉敏感词汇。 </p>

			<p> 居然在这些论坛中还有一个是关于游戏的。里面正在讨论的是一个如何帮助别人使用健康词汇的网络游戏，玩家可以操纵一名小男孩在街上侦察，看是否有人使用了敏感词汇，小男孩可以选择上前指责或者通知警察，抓到的人越多，小男孩得到的褒奖就越高。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登随便打开了几个论坛，里面的人都彬彬有礼，说话很"健康"，就好象街上的那些行人一样。不，准确地说，比街上的气氛还要压抑。在街上的人也许还有机会保留一下自己的小动作，比如阿瓦登刚才在公共汽车上就偷偷地写了TITLE五个字母；而在网上论坛，人的最后的一点隐私也全被暴露出来，有关部门随时可以调看你的一切行动，无从遁形，这就是科学技术发展所带来的进步。 </p>

			<p> 一阵失落和失望袭上阿瓦登的心头，他合上眼睛，把鼠标甩开，重重地向后靠去。原来他天真地以为BBS论坛也许会少许宽松一些，现在看来甚至比现实中更叫人窒息，他感觉到自己好象陷入沉滞的电子淤泥之中，艰于呼吸。"FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH"再一次涌现到他的唇边，强烈无比，要化好大的力气才控制住。 </p>

			<p> 忽然，他又想到了那个神秘的title，那究竟是什么意思？那五张光盘里或许隐藏着什么？也许这跟title有关系？ </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登想到这里，把目光重新转向电脑屏幕，仔细去看网络安全部发来的五封信的title部分。五张光盘各隐藏着一个字母，凑到一起就是title，那么按照这个方式，那五封EMAIL的title凑到一起，就变成了一句话：去用户学习论坛。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登记得刚才他确实看到其中一个论坛的名字叫做"用户学习"，于是他抱着姑且一试的心态连接到这个论坛去。他希望这并不是一个巧合。 </p>

			<p> 用户论坛是一个事务性论坛，里面是一些关于BBS用户资料的投诉帖和管理帖，斑竹的是一个叫19387465的人；发帖的人和回帖的人数量都很少，里面冷冷清清的。阿瓦登打开帖子列表，按照刚才的规律去搜寻每一个帖子的标题，并把它们综合到一起，很快他就得到了另外一句话： </p>

			<p> "每周日辛普森大楼5层B户。" </p>

			<p> 又是一个谜团，阿瓦登想。但这却坚定了他的信心，这其中必定隐藏着玄机。光盘、EMAIL和BBS论坛，连续三次都可以通过首词组组合的方式得到暗示，绝非巧合。 </p>

			<p> 究竟是什么人会在有关部门的官方文件中隐藏着这样的信息呢？每周日在效率大楼5层B户又会发生什么事情呢？ </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登终于找到了久违的兴奋感，未知事物的新奇刺激着他麻木很久的神经。更重要的是，这种在有关部门正式文件中玩弄的文字技巧，叫他有一种喘息的快感，仿佛一个密不透风的铁面罩上几个透进空气的小孔。 </p>

			<p> 营造健康的互联网络。 </p>

			<p> FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登盯着屏幕上的桌面背景，用嘴唇比出了那句粗话的口型，并且比出了中指。 </p>

			<p> 在接下来的日子里，阿瓦登一直处于一种潜藏的兴奋状态，就象是一个摆出无辜表情嘴里却藏着糖果的小孩子，在大人转身过去之后露出狡黠的笑容，尽情享受心中藏有秘密的乐趣。 </p>

			<p> 日子一天一天地过去，健康词汇在列表里又少了几个，窗外的空气又浑浊了几分，这已经是生活的常态。阿瓦登自己已经开始拿网络健康词汇表当日历来用，划掉三个词就证明过了三天，划掉七个就证明过了一周，于是周日终于到来了。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登抵达辛普森大楼的时间是中午，暗示的句子里并没有指明时间，阿瓦登认为在中午前往应该是比较可以接受的。当穿着深绿军大衣，耳朵上别着旁观者的阿瓦登来到辛普森大楼的入口时，他的心开始忐忑不安地跳跃起来。他在上一星期设想了无数种可能发生的情景，而现在这个谜底就要揭晓了。无论在周日效率大楼会发生什么，也不会比现在的生活更加糟糕，阿瓦登心里想，所以他并不怎么害怕。 </p>

			<p> 他走进大楼内部，发现这里的人也很少，空旷的走廊里只听到他哒哒的脚步声与回音。一部老电梯里贴着"缔造美好网络家园"的广告，以及一个充满了正义感的男性头像海报，背景是星条旗，他在纸里用右手食指指向观看者，头上写着一行字是"公民，请使用健康词汇。"阿瓦登厌恶地转过身去，发现另外一侧也贴着同样的海报，避无可避。 </p>

			<p> 值得庆幸的是五楼很快就到了，电梯的门一开，对面的门上就赫然挂着B户的牌子。门是掉了漆的绿色，门框上还点了几滴墨水，一部简易的电子门铃挂在右上角。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登深深吸了一口气，伸手去按电纽。 </p>

			<p> 电铃响起，很快屋子里传来脚步声。阿瓦登觉得这脚步的韵律很熟悉，似乎是在哪里见到过。门"咔拉"一声被打开一半，一名年轻女子一手握着把手，把身体前倾望着阿瓦登，警惕地说： </p>

			<p> "你，找谁？" </p>

			<p> 女子疑惑地问道。阿瓦登一下子就认出了她的声音，就是那个在网络部BBS论坛科柜台后面的女性。她很漂亮，穿着墨绿色绒线衫，头上梳着这时代流行的短发，皮肤特别的白，只有嘴唇能看到一些血色。 </p>

			<p> 看着女子的眼神，一瞬间阿瓦登不知道该说什么好，犹豫了一下，他举起右手，轻声回答说："title。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登不知道这句话能否奏效，也不知道自己是否真的找对了地方，但这是他唯一能想到的回答了。他紧张地望着那女子，假如那女子忽然报警，那么自己就会被抓起来仔细审问为什么无缘无故跑到陌生人家里。"肆意游走罪"只比"使用敏感词汇罪"轻那么一点。 </p>

			<p> 女子听到他这么说，脸上还是毫无表情，只是把头幅度很轻微地点了一下，右手谨慎地做了一个"进来"的手势。阿瓦登刚要张口，那女子严厉地瞪了他一眼，吓的他把话又吞回去了，乖乖地跟着她进了屋子。 </p>

			<p> 一进屋子，女子首先做的就是把门关好，然后拉起来一层铅灰色的门帘挡在门口。阿瓦登不安地眨着眼睛，趁她拉门帘的时候环顾四周。这屋子是标准的两室一厅，在厅里摆放的是一套双人沙发与一个茶几，茶几上居然还有几束红紫色的塑料花。靠墙是电脑桌和电脑，墙上挂着普通的白色日历，但被主人用粉红色的纸套了边，看起来颇为温馨。一盏粗笨的日光灯从天花板上垂下来，上面象是恶作剧一样挂了几缕绿色的电线，象是垂下藤蔓的葡萄架。阿瓦登注意到厅口的鞋架上有四双鞋，尺码不同，说明今天的客人并不只他一个。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登正踌躇不安，忽然女子从背后拍了拍他的肩膀，示意他朝里面走。于是两个人穿过客厅另一侧的短小回廊来到其中一间卧室。卧室上挂着同样质地的铅灰色帘子，女子伸手举起帘布，推开了门。阿瓦登迈了进去，首先映入眼帘的是三名面带微笑的人类，以及一间用真正的鲜花装点的房间。屋子里有很多旧日记忆里的古老物品，比如一幅印象派的油画、一尊乌干达木雕，甚至还有一个银烛台，唯独没有电脑。 </p>

			<p> 他正在迟疑，女子也进了屋子。她谨慎地拉好门帘关上门，将耳边的旁观者取下，回过身来对阿瓦登用曼妙的声音说道： </p>

			<p> "欢迎加入说话会！" </p>

			<p> "说话会？" </p>

			<p> 出于习惯，阿瓦登并没有把这三个字说出口，因为他不确定是否"健康"，只是用眼神表示自己的疑惑。 </p>

			<p> "在这里你可以随便说话，这个该死的东西不会起作用的。"女子把自己的旁观者晃了晃，那个小东西象死掉了一样，对女子句子里两个敏感词汇"随便"和"该死"充耳不闻。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登一下子想到上星期在公共汽车站前碰到的男子，如果他摘下旁观者，会不会也会落到同一境地呢？那女子见他犹豫不决，指了指门口的铅灰色门帘说："放心好了，这里是可以屏蔽掉旁观者信号的，不会有人觉察到。" </p>

			<p> "你们，是什么，人，这，是，哪里？" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登一边摘下耳朵上的旁观者，一边小声说道，语调还是改不了那种有关部门规定的说话方式。 </p>

			<p> "这里是说话会，是一个完全自由场所，在这里你可以畅所欲言，请不要拘束。" </p>

			<p> 另外一个人起身对他说道，这是一名瘦高的中年男子，鼻梁上的眼镜非常地厚。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登嗫嚅着，却找不到发音的焦点，在四个人的注视下显得窘迫不堪，脸都要红起来。女子同情地看了他一眼："可怜的家伙，不用太紧张，每一个刚到这里的人都是这样。慢慢就习惯了。" </p>

			<p> 她把手搭到阿瓦登的肩上："我们其实见过的，当然，我见过你，而你没见过我。"她一边说，一边将自己的头发解下来，原来她留的是一头齐肩的乌黑长发，头发披下来的一瞬间阿瓦登觉得她真的很美。 </p>

			<p> "我...我记得你，记得你的声音。"阿瓦登终于说出了一句完整的话，虽然不够流畅。 </p>

			<p> "是吗，那可太好了。"女子笑起来，拉着他的手，让他坐到沙发上，递给他一杯水。阿瓦登注意到这是一个款式古老的茶杯，上面还刻着花纹，杯子里的水带着浓郁的香气，阿瓦登尝了一点，那种甜丝丝的味道对喝惯纯净水的舌头来说刺激格外地大。让他觉得浑身一下子被注进了许多活力。 </p>

			<p> "弄到这个可不容易，我们也不是每周都能喝到。"女子坐到他身边，两只乌黑的眼睛注视着他，"你是怎么知道这个集会的？" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登把发现光盘暗示的过程说了一遍，其他四个人都赞许地点了点头。"果然是个聪明人，脑筋还没被陈腐的空气腐蚀掉。"一个三十多岁的胖子称赞道，他的嗓门大的要命。那个戴眼镜的中年人把两只手交叉在一起，表示赞同。 </p>

			<p> "这正是天生的说话会成员，聪明、敏锐，而且不甘屈从于沉默。" </p>

			<p> "那么。"胖子提议，"先让我们鼓掌欢迎说话会的新成员吧。" </p>

			<p> 于是四个人鼓起掌来，小小的屋子里响起一片掌声。阿瓦登羞涩地举起杯子做回应，他还不太习惯这样的场面。等到掌声稍息，他抬起头怯生生地问道： </p>

			<p> "可以问个问题吗？说话会到底是什么？" </p>

			<p> 带他进屋的女子伸出食指，在他鼻子前两公分的地方比了一比，解释道： </p>

			<p> "说话会，就是可以畅所欲言的集会。在这里你不必顾忌什么，说出任何你想说的东西。这里没有敏感词汇，也没有健康互联网络。这里是绝对自由的空间，你可以尽情释放你的灵魂，舒展你的身体，没有任何禁锢与束缚。"说着说着，她的声音变的高亢、奔放，里面饱含了许多早已经被屏蔽掉的词汇，阿瓦登不曾听到这样流畅连贯的话语很久了。 </p>

			<p> "我们的宗旨就是，说话，就这么简单。"中年人扶扶眼镜，补充道。 </p>

			<p> "可是，要说些什么呢？"阿瓦登又问道。 </p>

			<p> "任何事情，你心里想的任何事情都可以说出来。"中年人露出宽和的笑容，"尤其是那些被美国政府限制的思想。" </p>

			<p> 这可真是一个大胆的集会啊，这分明就是犯罪，阿瓦登心想，但他发觉自己却被这种犯罪慢慢地吸引住了。 </p>

			<p> "当然，有件事我们会事先说明。说话会是危险的，每一个成员都冒着被有关部门拘捕的风险。联邦执法人员也随时可能破门而入，以非法集会以及非法使用不合法词语的名义把我们抓起来。你现在有权拒绝加入，并且离开。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登听到女子的警告，心里一度犹豫起来。但一想到此刻离去的话，那么又要开始持续那种窒息的泥沼生活，他就难以压抑自己的烦闷。阿瓦登第一次发现，原来"说话"对他来说是一个致命的诱惑，他先前并不知道自己原来是如此地渴望着说话。 </p>

			<p> "我不会离开的，我要加入你们，说话。" </p>

			<p> "那太好了。唔，那么不妨就从自我介绍开始吧。"女子高兴地说，同时站起身来，把右手搭到胸前，"从我开始。我的名字叫阿尔特弥斯，至于网络编号和身份证号码，让他们见鬼去吧！谁会去管那个！我有我自己的名字，我不是数字。" </p>

			<p> 她的话让所有人包括阿瓦登都笑了起来。接着她继续说道："不过，这其实只是一个假名，这是希腊神话里的女神。" </p>

			<p> "假名？" </p>

			<p> "是的，和我户籍本上的名字是不同的。" </p>

			<p> "可是，为什么？" </p>

			<p> "你不会对自己在档案里的名字厌倦吗？我想起一个自己喜欢的名字，哪怕只有一次机会也好，自己想叫什么就叫什么。在这个说话会里的每一个人都有一个自己喜欢的名字，我们彼此拿这个称呼。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登若有所思地点点头，他很理解阿尔特弥斯的想法。事实上当他在使用网络论坛的时候，也希望能够自己取一个称心如意的名字，而不是被分配一个用户名。 </p>

			<p> 通过介绍，阿瓦登了解到阿尔特弥斯是网络部BBS论坛管理科的职员，今年23岁，未婚，最讨厌蟑螂和蜘蛛，喜欢缝纫与园艺，屋子里的花就是她偷偷从城市边缘摘回来的。 </p>

			<p> 接下来是那名中年人，他自我介绍说名字叫兰斯洛特，41岁，是城市电厂的一名工程师；兰斯洛特这名字出自英国的亚瑟王传说，是一名忠贞的骑士。他有自己的老婆和两个孩子，一男一女；男孩三岁，女孩四岁，他们最喜欢吃的就是柠檬味道的水果糖。说到这里，兰斯洛特说希望下次聚会能把他们也带了，孩子们正是学说话的时候，他想教给他们真正的说话。 </p>

			<p> 那个三十多岁的胖子是网络部的一名网管，叫瓦格纳。这个身份让阿瓦登吃惊不已，他的印象里网管都是些绷着脸全无表情的冷漠生物，但眼前的瓦格纳脸圆滚滚的，油光锃亮，嘴边两条翘起的小胡子神气十足。他喜欢的是雪茄和歌剧，利用网管的特权这两样东西都不难弄到。 </p>

			<p> "这个能屏蔽掉信号的门帘就是他弄的。"阿尔特弥斯补充说，瓦格纳冲她做了个"乐意为您效劳"的手势，然后点燃了雪茄，把它放到嘴里，很快屋子里就笼罩起一片稀薄的烟雾。 </p>

			<p> 说话会的第四名成员是一位穿着黑色制服的女性，今年刚满三十。她的名字是杜拉丝，城市日报（那个时代的报纸已经全部都数字化了）的编辑，她比阿尔特弥斯还瘦，颧骨高高耸起，眼窝身陷，两片薄薄的嘴唇即使在最说话的时候也很少分开，看不到牙齿。爱好是饲养狗和猫，尽管她并没有养。 </p>

			<p> "那么，到你了。"阿尔特弥斯对阿瓦登说。阿瓦登想了想，结结巴巴地把自己的情况说了一遍，当谈到自己的爱好时候，他一时间居然想不到自己喜好什么，似乎什么都没有，在那之前他甚至从来没想过。 </p>

			<p> "那，你最想做的是什么事呢？"阿尔特弥斯把手再一次放在他肩上，诱导着问道。 </p>

			<p> "真的什么都可以？" </p>

			<p> "什么都可以，在这里没有任何限制。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登觉得自己终于找到机会了，他咳了一声，抓抓头，脱口而出一句响亮的叫喊："FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH！" </p>

			<p> 在一瞬间，在座的四个人都被他这句话震惊了。瓦格纳率先反应了过来，他先叼住雪茄，用力鼓掌，然后用右手把雪茄取下来，张嘴大声地赞叹道："真棒，痛快，这简直是最完美的入会誓词。" </p>

			<p> "我宁可听十遍这样的脏话，也不想再去碰那个乏味的电子女声。"兰斯洛特也是一脸陶醉，毫不掩饰自己对电子女声的厌恶。而阿尔特弥斯和杜拉丝全都咯咯地笑起来，杜拉丝发现自己的笑容幅度大了一点，不好意思地把嘴掩住。阿瓦登觉得他们与其说是觉得新奇，不如说是在享受这句脏话所带来的对体制的蔑视与挑战。 </p>

			<p> "那你叫希望自己叫什么名字呢？" 阿尔特弥斯歪着头问。 </p>

			<p> "唔...王二。" 阿瓦登沉吟了一下，回答说。这是一个中式的名字，他以前有一个中国人朋友，喜欢讲故事，故事里的主角名字总是叫王二。 </p>

			<p> 屋子里的气氛现在完全融洽了，大家都开始谈些比较自然的话题，每个人都摆出了最舒服的姿势，阿尔特弥斯不时拿起茶壶来为大家续水。阿瓦登紧张的心情逐渐放松下来，他感觉到自己的脑子前所未有地轻松。 </p>

			<p> "你知道的。"阿尔特弥斯又给他倒了一杯甜水，"我们一直想把说话会保持在一定规模，平日是没有办法畅所欲言的，我们需要空间。麻烦的是，我们没办法公开征集会员，又不可能直接通过物理接触去寻找，那风险太大。于是兰斯洛特就设计了一套暗示系统，只有发现这些暗示的人才能知道本会的存在。" </p>

			<p> "这套系统考虑到的还不止是安全问题。"兰斯洛特把自己的眼镜摘下来仔细擦拭了一下，得意地说，"这其实也是一个会员资格验证。说话会所吸纳的成员，必须有智慧，有头脑，内心渴望激情，并且对自由有着渴望。" </p>

			<p> 瓦格纳用两根指头夹着雪茄，在事先准备好的烟灰缸里弹了弹烟灰，大声说道："据我的经验，申请BBS论坛服务的人，大多数都是为了怀旧，或者说渴望一些新鲜的东西，这样的人往往都怀有激情，认为BBS论坛也许能给他们一些与现实不一样的东西--当然，事实上并非如此，美国政府对BBS论坛的管理甚至严厉过电子邮件--这暗示着他们心里渴望解脱束缚。因此我们将暗示隐藏在申请BBS论坛的光盘之中，只有申请人才有机会接触到这些暗示。而只有那些有智慧、观察敏锐的人才会发觉到这些暗示的存在，并顺利解读出来，找到这里。" </p>

			<p> "归根到底，说话会也不过是一群渴望自由说话的秘密小团体罢了。"兰斯洛特笑道。 </p>

			<p> "你是第二个找到说话会的人，第一个是杜拉丝小姐。" </p>

			<p> 阿尔特弥斯告诉阿瓦登。阿瓦登敬佩地看了杜拉丝一眼，后者淡淡地回答道："这没什么，这是我的工作，我的工作就是摆弄文字。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登想到上一周在公共汽车站碰到的那个疯狂男子，于是把这件事讲给其他成员听。听完之后，兰斯洛特摇了摇头，从嘴唇里滑出一声叹息： </p>

			<p> "这样的事情我也是见过的，我的一个同事就是如此。所以说话会的存在是必要的，这是缓解压力的阀门。长时间的敏感词汇限制会让人都疯掉的，因为他们既无法思考又没办法表达。" </p>

			<p> "这正是美国政府有关部门所希望看到的，这样只有傻瓜能够存活下来，一个全是傻瓜的社会是稳定的。" 瓦格纳费力地把自己肥胖的身躯挪了一下位置，轻蔑地说。 </p>

			<p> "你也是有关部门的一分子，瓦格纳先生。"阿尔特弥斯一边往茶杯里续了些热水，一边抬头轻声说道。 </p>

			<p> "阿尔特弥斯小姐，我只是一个能比普通人多使用几个敏感词汇的普通人而已。" </p>

			<p> 大家都笑了起来。阿瓦登从来没有见过这么多的人说这么多的话，这是前所未有的奇妙经验。他惊讶地发现自己居然很快就融进了这个小圈子里，隔阂与陌生感很快就消失了；同时消失的还有胸闷与头晕等习惯性的毛病。 </p>

			<p> 很快话题就从说话会本身扩展到了更加宽泛随意的话题，阿尔特弥斯唱支歌，兰斯洛特说了几个笑话，杜拉丝则给大家讲了美国南部诸州的风土人情；瓦格纳甚至还唱了一段歌剧，虽然阿瓦登一个字也听不懂，但他一点也不吝惜掌声。在这个城市的某一个被屏蔽掉的角落里，五个不甘沉默的人正在享受着在这个时代视为奢侈品的事情--说话。 </p>

			<p>  "王二，你可曾看过《1984》？" </p>

			<p> 阿尔特弥斯忽然问道，她就靠着阿瓦登坐下，阿瓦登摇摇头，反问道："这是网络编号的一段么？" </p>

			<p> "这是一本书的名字。" </p>

			<p> "书？"阿瓦登听到这个名词，头摇的更大了。这是个古老的名词，在这个电脑技术非常发达的时代，网络可以承载一切信息，任何人都可以在网上图书馆查到电子版；因此有关部门认为实体书籍变成了一种没有必要存在的浪费，实体书也就逐渐消亡了。瓦格纳对此的评论是："有关部门喜欢电子书籍的心情是可以理解的，电子书籍的话，只需要FIND和REPLACE两个命令就可以消灭掉全部不健康词汇，替一本书消毒；而实体书籍的校对与修订却是件旷日持久的工作。" </p>

			<p> "这是一本伟大的书，是旧世界哲人们对我们这个时代的预言。"阿尔特弥斯认真地说。"它很早以前就洞察到了肉的束缚与解脱，灵的束缚与解脱，这是说话会的基石。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登不无惊奇地发现他的网络编号开头恰好是这这本书名字：19842015。 </p>

			<p> "那么，该怎么样才能看到呢？"阿瓦登盯着阿尔特弥斯乌黑色的眼睛问。 </p>

			<p> "我们也无法找到纸质版，网络图书馆不可能存在这样的书。"兰斯洛特摇摇头，然后重新露出笑容，左手向着杜拉丝摆了个请的姿势，"但我们的杜拉丝小姐应该为她的记忆力而自豪，她在很早已经有幸阅读过这两本书，并且能够记得里面的大部分文字。" </p>

			<p> "太好了，然后她写下来了，对吗？" </p>

			<p> "那太危险，这时代持有实体书是个大罪过，也容易让说话会暴露。我们只是在每次聚会的时候请杜拉丝小姐为我们背诵。既然是说话会，那么把这两个故事讲出来不是更名符其实吗？" </p>

			<p> 大家都安静下来，杜拉丝站起来走到屋子中央，其他四个人坐在旁边看着她。阿瓦登不经意地把手搂在阿尔特弥斯肩上，后者微微朝这边靠过来，女性头发的幽香"咝咝"地划过他的鼻子，让他的心里一阵荡漾。屋子里非常暖和，他分不清这是花香还是阿尔特弥斯的味道。 </p>

			<p> 杜拉丝的声音并不高，不过却很清晰有力；她的记忆力确实惊人，不仅记得情节，包括一些细节和句子都可以复述下来。杜拉丝讲到了朱丽亚假装摔倒，然后偷偷递给温斯顿一张写着"我爱你"的纸条，绘声绘色，这让听众们都听的入神了，阿尔特弥斯听的尤其认真，以至于都没有注意到阿瓦登一直注视着她。 </p>

			<p> "1984的作者预见到了专制的进步，却没有预见到技术的进步。"瓦格纳在杜拉丝停下来喝水的时候发表自己的评论，阿瓦登觉得他与外貌不太相称，是个很有洞察力的技术官僚。 </p>

			<p> "在大洋国人们还可以靠传递纸条来偷偷表达自己的想法，但是现在不一样了。美国政府有关部门把我们全赶到了网上，而在网络技术发达的今天，我们即使想发一条短信都会被系统或者网管看的一清二楚，无从遁形。现实里呢，还有旁观者在。"瓦格纳在腿上敲了敲雪茄根部，"一句话，技术是中性的，但技术的进步会让自在的世界更自在，集权的世界更加集权。" </p>

			<p> "这句话说的很有哲学家的味道哟。"阿尔特弥斯冲瓦格纳挤了挤眼睛，从抽屉里取来一把饼干和曲奇散发给大家。 </p>

			<p> "就好象同样是0和1，有的人就能写出工具软件，有人却拿那个编出恶性病毒？" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登想到一个类似的比喻，瓦格纳听了以后满意地打了个响指。 </p>

			<p> "很不错的比喻，王二，就是如此，真不愧是程序员。" </p>

			<p> 谈话持续了不知道有多久，杜拉斯看了一眼墙壁上的挂钟，连忙提醒谈兴正浓的四个人时间快到了。说话会不能持续很长时间，旁听者被屏蔽的越久，暴露的危险就越大。 </p>

			<p> "那么好吧，我们就抓紧最后半个小时来完成今天的活动。" </p>

			<p> 阿尔特弥斯一边说着，一边将桌子上的空杯子收走。兰斯洛特和瓦格纳也都站起身来，活动一下已经有些酸疼的肩膀和腰，只有杜拉丝坐在位子上没有动。 </p>

			<p> "活动？还有什么活动？" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登奇怪地问道，说话会除了说话还有其他活动？ </p>

			<p> "唔，对啊，我们还有其他活动。"阿尔特弥斯撩起额前的长发，对他妩媚一笑："我们还会和对方完全交流。" </p>

			<p> "完全交流？" </p>

			<p> "就是intercourse" </p>

			<p> ".................."阿瓦登一下子变的脸色苍白，呼吸急促起来，仿佛胃里被灌进去零下三十度的寒风，他几乎不相信自己的耳朵。 </p>

			<p> "说话会有说话的自由，也有选择与谁上床的自由。"阿尔特弥斯毫不羞涩地说，"我们互相谈话，然后选择合适的人做爱，就象我们选择我们喜欢的词汇说话一样。" </p>

			<p> 兰斯洛特看阿瓦登很窘迫，走过去拍拍他的肩膀，慢慢地说："当然，我们不会强迫任何人，这完全是在自愿的基础上。今天我还要早点回去照顾小孩，你们人数正好合适。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登的脸色涨红，热的仿佛夏季的电脑CPU，他甚至不敢多看阿尔特弥斯一眼。他憧憬过女性很长时间，但如此接近还是第一次。 </p>

			<p> 还要回家去照顾小孩子的兰斯洛特向大家道别后就先行离去了，阿尔特弥斯将房间留给瓦格纳与杜拉丝，然后带着惶恐不安的阿瓦登来到了另外一间房间。这间显然是阿尔特弥斯的卧室，屋子里很简单，但却收拾的十分干净，在床上枕头旁还摆着一个手制的布娃娃，床单和窗帘都是粉红色的。 </p>

			<p> 最初的是由阿尔特弥斯主动开始的，丝毫没心理准备的阿瓦登只是被动地任她摆布。经过了几轮挑逗，阿瓦登才逐渐放开，任由潜藏在自己心内的原始欲望奔流出来，那种期待听到圆润女声的青春憧憬本来只是苦闷生活的意淫，而在今天它加倍实现了。很快这种憧憬与他在现实中被压抑的郁闷合流，转化成了猛烈的冲动，让他一次又一次与阿尔特弥斯融为一体。阿瓦登不知道这种冲动和他想大声说出"FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH"冲动有什么不同，不过现在不是考虑这个的时候，他现在脑子里想的只有尽情地、全无束缚地让自己释放激情，完全没有任何束缚。 </p>

			<p> 强烈的刺激一波波地冲击着兴奋中枢，最终一阵快感浪潮在狂暴洋面扬起头来，达到了一个极高的顶端。阿瓦登在那一瞬间感觉到了前所未有的自由，那种轻盈无比的自由，以及因自由而生的快乐与疲惫。浑身是汗的他喘息着倒在了阿尔特弥斯身上，一阵舒畅的倦意如潮水般淹没了他的身体... </p>

			<p> ...当他醒来的时候，发现阿尔特弥斯躺在自己身边，赤裸的身体好象一尊白玉雕像，睡姿恬美静谧。他侧过身子去，慵懒地打了个呵欠，然后阿尔特弥斯睁开了眼睛。 </p>

			<p> "很舒服，对不对？"她问道。 </p>

			<p> "是啊..."阿瓦登不知道该说什么好，他顿了顿，犹豫地说道："你以前和兰斯洛特、瓦格纳他们也...呃，我是说，象刚才那样子过吗？" </p>

			<p> "是的。"阿尔特弥斯温柔地回答，她半支起胳膊，长发从肩膀披到了胸口。她的大方坦白反而让阿瓦登有些不知所措。屋子里出现了一段时间的沉默，然后阿尔特弥斯忽然开口问道： </p>

			<p> "还记得今天杜拉丝讲的那段故事吗？女主角偷偷递给男主角写着"我爱你"的纸条。" </p>

			<p> "唔，还记得。"阿瓦登回答，很高兴终于能从那个拙劣的话题摆脱出来了。 </p>

			<p> "在有关部门的健康互联网络词汇列表里，没有爱这个字呢。在我们这个时代，我爱你也是一个敏感词汇，被屏蔽掉了。"阿尔特弥斯的眼神里似乎是感慨，又象是失落。 </p>

			<p> "我爱你。"阿瓦登不禁脱口而出，他知道在这间屋子里可以说出任何自己想说的话，不必顾忌。 </p>

			<p> "谢谢你。" </p>

			<p> 阿尔特弥斯听到之后只是笑了笑，起身穿上衣服，催促阿瓦登时间差不多了。阿瓦登有些失望，因为她没有预期反应的热烈，仿佛他刚才说的只是有些无关紧要的东西。 </p>

			<p> 这时候杜拉丝和瓦格纳已经离开了，屋子里只剩他们两个人。阿尔特弥斯把他送到门口，将旁观者交给他，然后叮嘱他说："记得在外面绝对不要提及说话会的任何事情或者任何人，我们在说话会以外的地方是完全不认识的。" </p>

			<p> "我记住了。"阿瓦登回答，然后转身要走。 </p>

			<p> "王二。" </p>

			<p> 阿尔特弥斯忽然叫道，阿瓦登连忙转身，还没等他反应过来，两片柔软温暖的嘴唇忽然贴到了他的双唇，然后是一个细切的声音在耳边响起："谢谢你，我爱你。" </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登觉得眼睛有些湿润，他戴上旁观者，推开门，重新步入到那一片令人窒息的世界中去，但他此时已与来时的心境大不相同。 </p>

			<p> 此后阿瓦登的精神面貌明显有了改善。他谨慎地享受着这种秘密集会的乐趣，并且乐在其中。每一周或者两周，他们五个人都会在周日秘密地举行说话会的活动，聊天，唱歌或者听杜拉丝讲1984的故事。阿瓦登同阿尔特弥斯又"完全交流"了几次，偶尔他也会跟杜拉丝"交流"。他有了两个身份，一个是现实中和网上的阿瓦登，编号19842015，还有一个是说话会里的王二。他很享受这个名字，觉得这就是自己另外的一个人生。 </p>

			<p> 有一次集会，他们谈到了敏感词汇的问题。阿瓦登记得很早的时候--他对这方面的记忆有点模糊--有关部门给出的是一份敏感词汇列表，由网站的内部管理人员秘密参考使用，他对如何演变成现在的局面大惑不解。那一天瓦格纳带了一瓶葡萄酒，兴致很高，于是索性给他们讲了讲"屏蔽"的进化史，身为网管的他经常可以接触到这些资料。 </p>

			<p> 在最开始美国政府只是单纯地屏蔽掉敏感词汇，但很快他们就发现这样的措施根本没有用处。很多人会采取在词组中夹杂符号或者数字的方式来绕开系统检查；于是有关部门不得不将这些近似敏感词汇也一一屏蔽掉。然而众所周知，数字与符号之间的组合方式是近乎无限的，只要你有想象力，就完全可以组合出一个新的词组而且不失掉他的原意。比如说"politic"这个词，就有"politi/c"、"政polit/ic"、"pol/itic"等近乎无限种表达方式。 </p>

			<p> 当有关部门意识到这个问题时，他们采取了新的策略。既然无法辨识词组，那么就用单词屏蔽。这一举措在一开始是奏效的，违规交谈的人显著减少，但很快人们就发现可以用同音字或者谐音的方式来继续表达自己的危险思想。即使有关部门封掉全部敏感词汇的同音字，也无济于事，思想活跃的美国人充分发挥了自己的想象力，使用隐喻，借代、类比、引申及其他修辞方法，或者将一个敏感词用数个不敏感的字来代替。人类的思维方式要比电脑开阔许多。电脑屏蔽掉一条路，他们还会有更多的路可以选择。 </p>

			<p> 这一场水面以下的角力看起来似乎是美国大众要取得胜利。这时候，一个具有逆向思维精神的人出现了。他的身份不明。有人说他是有关部门的主管；也有人说他是因过度使用敏感词汇而被捕的危险人士。无论他是谁，总之整个局面被扭转过来。他向有关部门建议，不再告诉大众禁止说什么，而是规定他们只能说什么，用什么方式去说。有关部门很快就心领神会，制订了新的规章制度：取消了敏感词汇列表，取而代之的是互联网络健康语言列表，并把这举措推广到了日常生活中的语言屏蔽系统中去。 </p>

			<p> 这一次，大众终于处于下风。以往他们与有关部门尽情地在网络与现实中捉着迷藏，而现在他们却被有关部门扼住了咽喉。这样一来，有关部门可以有效率地掌握住言论，因为整个语言的框架都被彻底控制了。在有限的空间内，大众几乎是无计可施。 </p>

			<p> 尽管如此，大众还是不屈不挠地将这场战争--或者说游戏--继续下去，他们挑选健康词汇列表中的合法字眼来表达不合法的意思：两个连续的"稳定"意思就是"反对"，"稳定"加"繁荣昌盛"则暗示"屏蔽"。美国政府不得不对这一动向保持着警惕，并日复一日地将更多的词汇从健康词汇列表里删掉，禁止大众使用。 </p>

			<p> "当然，这场战争会持续下去的。只要世界上还存在着两个不同的字或者词组，那么就可以继续自由交流--你知道莫尔斯电码吧？" </p>

			<p> 瓦格纳说到这里，拿起茶杯一饮而尽，满意地打了一个嗝。 </p>

			<p> "可是，这场战争的代价就是语言的失落。表达能力会越来越贫乏，越来越淡而无味，人们会越来越倾向于沉默，这对有关部门反而是好事。"兰斯洛特摆出一副忧虑的表情，有节奏地用指关节敲击着桌面，"这样一来，岂不就等于是大众的自由意识将语言推向死亡的边缘？真讽刺啊。按照这个趋势，有关部门是不会败的，他们会笑到最后。" </p>

			<p> "不，不，笑这种情感他们是不会了解的。"瓦格纳淡淡地回答。 </p>

			<p> "我倒是觉得，美国是一直处于恐惧的情感之中呢，生怕人们掌握了太多的词汇，表达出太多的思想，变的难以掌握。"阿尔特弥斯说完摆出一副她在上班期间冷若冰霜的呆板脸孔，学着僵硬的腔调喊了一句："营造健康的网络环境，美国万岁！" </p>

			<p> 杜拉丝、兰斯洛特与瓦格纳都哈哈大笑，唯一没笑的是王二（阿瓦登）。他对于兰斯洛特刚才的那句话始终耿耿于怀：大众与有关部门的对抗，其最终结局就是语言的消亡。那么他们现在这个小小的说话会，也只不过是在一列开向悬崖的列车里关上窗帘，享受坠毁前最后的宁静罢了。 </p>

			<p> 不过他没有说出口，因为这太煞风景了。阿瓦登不希望破坏说话会的气氛，这对他很重要。 </p>

			<p> 从说话会回到家里，阿瓦登躺在行军床上，双手枕着脑袋，陷入了沉思。自从加入说话会以后，他变的比以前更容易陷入思考。有时候他想的是这个社会、这个互联网络或者这座城市中存在的荒谬性；有时候他想的是自己的生活；还有时候他想的是阿尔特弥斯。他不知道是不是在一个压抑的世界里，人的情感会变的格外强烈，他现在陷入对阿尔特弥斯的迷恋无法自拔。阿瓦登一直很羡慕杜拉丝讲的《1984》里面的温斯顿，他和朱利亚有一间两个人独处的小屋，一个只属于他们两个人的小世界。 </p>

			<p> 他在与阿尔特弥斯"完全交流"的时候曾经吐露过自己的心声，阿尔特弥斯没有直接回答，而是表示两个人的关系无法再比说话会更近一步--维持现在的状态就已经是个人行为的极限，有关部门可不会一直打瞌睡。"我们只能把感情生活压缩在每周一次的说话会活动里，这已经很奢侈了。"她对他说，同时温柔地抚摩他的胸膛。"只有在说话会里，我们才是阿尔特弥斯和王二。而在其他时间里，你是19842015，而我是19387465。" </p>

			<p> 对此，阿瓦登只能发出一声轻轻的叹息，确实他不该奢求更多。 </p>

			<p> 除了感情，发生变化的还有互联网络。自从加入说话会以后，阿瓦登逐渐发现互联网表面下潜藏的一些东西。正如瓦格纳在一次活动的时候指出，普罗大众与有关部门的战争从未结束，总会有思想和言论从严厉管制的缝隙中流泻出来。阿瓦登发现，在完全公式化的EMAIL与网络论坛中其实隐藏着不少耐人寻味的细节，就好象那个title一样，存在着各式各样的密码与隐藏寓意。这些东西出自不同人的手里，样式和破译方式都不同，阿瓦登不知道那些密码背后隐藏的是怎样的内容。不过有一点可以确知的是，说话会并不是唯一的一个地下集会，瓦格纳说的对，始终还是有人在试图用"健康"词汇表达"不健康"思想。 </p>

			<p> 讽刺的是，给阿瓦登感触最深的，是有关部门的管制。以往他只是模糊地感觉到自己被绑缚起来，现在他能清晰地看清这种束缚与压抑的脉络，以及加诸在自己身上的各种手段。在小小说话会中享受到的自在让他更加深刻地感受到在宽阔现实中的不自在。 </p>

			<p> "FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH！" </p>

			<p> 每一次的聚会，三位男士都会轻蔑地一起高喊这一句粗话。他们清楚这不会给有关部门带来什么不良影响，不过这确实很痛快。 </p>

			<p> 这一周，阿瓦登特别地忙碌，他的同事因为不明原因而被屏蔽掉了，这样一来整个项目就全压在了他一个人身上。这项目是为有关部分设计一种软件，用来控制大功率主动式"旁观者"的能源分配控制。软件很复杂，他不得不每天在电脑前工作十几个小时，只有在身体实在支撑不住的时候才停下来随便吃一点东西，喝一口纯净水，困了就躺在旁边的行军床上睡上一觉，爬起来继续工作。屋子里满是浑浊的烟味与袜子脏衣服的酸臭味，阿瓦登就在这种环境下蓬头垢面地敲着键盘，并不时揉揉满布血丝的眼睛。 </p>

			<p> 偏偏在这个时候屋子里的暖气坏掉了。洋灰色的暖气片从昨天开始就变的冰凉，不再有热水流动。阿瓦登检查了一下，发现并不是管道问题，而且邻居们也碰到同样的事，看来是供热系统出了问题。这一变故的正面影响是稍微淡化了屋子内的酸臭味，负面影响是整个屋子变的有如冰窖一样。紧闭的窗户和门能挡住寒风，却挡不住寒冷，低温让本来就寒酸的房间更笼罩上一层霜气。无论是那把木椅还是行军床都象是冷酷的冰雕，屋子里唯一还有些热气的就只剩下电脑。阿瓦登不得不披上所有的御寒衣物，蜷缩在床上，把电脑的散热口对准自己。 </p>

			<p> 有关部门宣布"供热"和"暖气"暂时也被列入敏感词汇，于是阿瓦登没办法写信向供热部门询问，只好静待，除了用来敲键盘的指头以外，尽量保持全身一动不动，以节约热量。在停止供暖后的第四天，暖气片里终于传来"哗啦哗啦"的声音，带着热气的水开始流动，屋子里恢复了温暖，"供热"和"暖气"又可以恢复使用了。于是EMAIL与网络论坛上全都是"庆祝有关部门恢复供应暖气，急人民之所急"的帖子，EMAIL新闻组里也全是类似主题。 </p>

			<p> 不过这对阿瓦登来说太晚了，他生了病，感冒，而且是重感冒。他面色苍白，全身软弱无力，头疼的象是被一枚达姆弹射入头部，只能躺在床上等医生。医生来到他家里，给他做了两三次点滴，喂了一些叫不上名字的药片，叫他静养。这一场病足足持续了数天，他不得不放弃参加这一星期的说话会，身体状况实在太差了，阿瓦登甚至怀疑自己搞不好会因此而死掉。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登躺在床上，心里懊悔不已，说话会是他唯一的乐趣，现在他却没办法参加。他把头蒙在被子里胡思乱想，瓦格纳这一次会带什么特别的东西来呢？兰斯洛特有没有把两个孩子也领过来？还有阿尔特弥斯，他没参加的话，她会和谁"完全交流"呢？瓦格纳还是兰斯洛特？他还想到了杜拉丝，上一次的聚会里，杜拉丝讲到了温斯顿在秘密幽会的屋子里对朱丽亚说"我们已经死了"，朱丽亚附和着说"我们已经死了"，这时候第三个声音说道"你们已经死了。" </p>

			<p> 杜拉丝就讲到这里，就停住了。阿瓦登急切地想知道接下来发生了什么，第三个声音是谁，是党吗？温斯顿和朱丽亚是否会被捕，他们会有什么样的下场？不光是他，阿尔特弥斯也很希望知道后续情节的发展，不过她并没有去追问杜拉丝。 </p>

			<p> "让这成为一个悬疑，这样接下来的一周我们的生活都会在期待的乐趣中度过。"她对阿瓦登说，然后两个人继续沉溺于intercourse的快乐。 </p>

			<p> "也许他们都会死。"阿尔特弥斯在交流结束后，看着天花板说。 </p>

			<p> "也许那只是奥布林的声音，他去探望他们。"阿瓦登安慰她道，但是他的心里也不确定。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登的病持续了十天，然后他终于痊愈了。他痊愈后的第一件事就是从床上爬起来，然后去看墙上的日历：这一天恰好是星期日，说话会活动的日子。阿瓦登已经缺席了一周，这已经令他如饥似渴，甚至做梦都在和他们一起喋喋不休地说着话--所幸他并没有说梦话的习惯，所以24小时工作的旁观者并没发出任何警报。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登简单地洗了一下脸，用一把有些生锈的剃刀沾着肥皂仔细地刮掉脸上粗硬的胡须，然后咕噜咕噜地刷了刷牙齿，用手和毛巾沾着热水将自己蓬起的乱发压下去。因为生病，有关部门发了一些补贴给他，其中包括两块羊角面包、两瓶姜汁啤酒和一份精制砂糖。他将这些东西都用塑料布仔细包好，揣到宽大的军大衣里，打算带到说话会上去与大家分享。 </p>

			<p> 今天的天气和往常一样地冷，阿瓦登把自己裹在大衣里，登上前往效率大楼的公共汽车。一路上车厢里的广播重复着"营造健康的互联网络"以及一些优秀网络用户的先进事迹；车厢前面的电子屏幕不断滚动显示着最新的健康词汇列表，一个旁观者自车顶垂下来睥睨着车内的每一个表情呆滞的人。阿瓦登坐在最后一排，望着窗外不断向后移动的建筑物与枯黄的树木发呆。 </p>

			<p> 车子很快就到达了辛普森大楼附近的车站，阿瓦登下了车，把手放到怀里摸了摸塑料布包着的食物，朝着大楼走去。他在半路无意中抬起头，忽然一阵冰冷的寒流刺入他的胸腔，迫使他停住了脚步。 </p>

			<p> 有什么地方不对劲！ </p>

			<p> 他看到了效率大楼的第五层阿尔特弥斯家的窗户发生了一些奇怪的变化。以前阿尔特弥斯家面向大街的窗户总是挂着粉红色的窗帘，而现在窗帘则被扯到了两边，窗户大开，用肉眼可以勉强看到窗玻璃和屋子里雪白的墙壁。假如今天有说话会的话，阿尔特弥斯绝对不会把有屏蔽效果的窗帘打开。而且打开窗户这件事也绝不寻常，在这个城市里的室外空气十分浑浊，几乎不会有人会去开窗换气。 </p>

			<p> 也就是说，今天并没有说话集会召开，而是发生了另外一些事情。阿瓦登望着那窗户，心情开始变的有些慌乱，他把手从兜里掏出来，叼起一支香烟，把身体靠在一根电线杆旁故做镇静，以免被行人怀疑。究竟说话会发生了什么，为什么这一周停办了呢？要知道，只要还有复数的成员能够出席，说话会就会一直办下去，难道说瓦格纳、兰斯洛特、杜拉丝和阿尔特弥斯同时无法出席？这种概率实在太小了。阿瓦登一边这样想着，一边向四周不安地张望。忽然他看到了一样东西，一个念头霎时占据了他的全部心灵，让他几乎眩晕过去。 </p>

			<p> "说话会本周不会有了，以后也不会有了。"阿瓦登嘴唇默默地蠕动着，面如死灰。 </p>

			<p> 他看到在街道内侧一处不起眼的地方隐藏着一个类似雷达天线的东西，其造型很象是两个背部贴在一起的大碗。阿瓦登心里清楚这是什么东西：这正是他负责软件设计的大功率主动式"旁观者"，这造型他很熟悉。这装置可以主动发射电波去探测人们的声音，并检查其中是否存在敏感词汇。 </p>

			<p> 这样的装置居然就安放在阿尔特弥斯家附近，那么就等于说话会完全暴露在了有关部门的监控之下。主动式旁观者的强大刺探电波会轻易刺穿她家中的铅质窗帘，把所有成员的话原封不动地传到有关部门耳朵里。 </p>

			<p> 这是一个划时代的发明，这一技术的突破意味着有关部门可以不再被动地等待警报，可以主动出击去刺探人们在任何时间任何地点说的任何话语。阿瓦登可以想象接下来会发生什么，阿尔特弥斯他们的每一句话都被有关部门记录下来，会有机器统计出到底有多少违禁词汇被他们使用过；然后联邦警察会冲进她的屋子，将正在聚会的成员们都带走，只留下搜查过后空荡荡的房间和窗户。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登想到这里，心如刀绞，他一点也不为自己的侥幸逃脱而感到幸运。他的胃袋翻腾起来，一种恶心的感觉从胃里直接升到嘴边，让他想吐，却又不能吐--因为"呕"也是个敏感词汇；大病初愈的孱弱身躯无法承受这种打击，象害了风寒一样颤抖起来，几乎站立不住。 </p>

			<p> 他不敢继续朝前走去，仓皇地转过身去，登上另外一辆公共汽车，把嘴闭的更紧了。等阿瓦登回到自己家楼下，看到楼房附近另外一架新的主动式旁观者正在兴建中，漆黑的天线在半空舒展开来，仿佛一面巨大的蜘蛛网。看来有关部门已经着手在整个纽约市部署这种新兴高科技产品。 </p>

			<p> 他不敢驻足观看，低着头从那巨大装置旁边走过，一路不停地走回家，然后把自己的脸紧紧地压在枕头里，却不敢哭出声音来，连一句"FUXKYOU, YOUSONOFBITCH"都不能说。 </p>

			<p> 从那以后，阿瓦登的生活回到了普通状态--就是说和原来一样沉滞、压抑、欠缺激情，健康向上，缺乏低级趣味。兰斯洛特说过："战争的结果就是，大众的自由意识会将语言推向死亡的边缘"，现在看来，他的预言是很准确的：说话会的覆灭，导致"说话"、"歌剧"、"完全"、"交流"几个词先后被剔除出了健康词汇列表，成为敏感词汇。 </p>

			<p> 另外，虽然阿拉伯数字还能用，但"1984"这一个数字组合也被屏蔽掉了，这让包括阿瓦登在内的程序员在编写程序时不得不谨慎地检查数字是否违规，这额外增加了很多工作量，让他更加疲惫。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登不是没有担心过，也许在某一天的深夜，他就会忽然接到一封EMAIL，让他留在家里不要动，不要试图在网络做任何动作；接着电话会响起，电子女声会把这一要求重复再重复，直到警察打开他家的大门，把他带去未知的地方，那里有未知的命运等待着他。《1984》后面的情节发展阿瓦登始终不知道，唯一知道的杜拉丝已经彻底失踪了，所以温斯顿和朱丽亚的结局始终是个谜；就好象兰斯洛特、瓦格纳、杜拉丝和阿尔特弥斯的结局一样，也不从得知。其实这两件事对于阿瓦登来说没什么本质性的区别，所以它们也可以看做是同一个谜。 </p>

			<p> 其实他最担心的，是阿尔特弥斯。每次想到这个名字，阿瓦登就难以抑制心中的郁闷。她究竟会怎么样，彻底被屏蔽掉吗？如果是那样，那么她在这世界上遗留下来的唯一痕迹，就是一个程序员记忆里的假名而已了。 </p>

			<p> 说话会消失后三个星期，仍旧风平浪静，没有任何人来找过阿瓦登，他也没收到过任何类似内容的EMAIL，阿瓦登一直在想，也许是他们没有吐露出自己的下落，也可能是因为他们根本不知道--他们认识的只是一个叫王二的程序员。这个城市里有数以千计的程序员，而王二是个假名。 </p>

			<p> 因此，生活一如既往地平静。不，确切地说，还是有一点不同的，那就是互联网络健康词汇列表：那上面的词组消失的速度比以前要快的快，每小时每分钟都有词与单字飞快地在名单上消失，阿瓦登不得不花上大量时间去更新列表，以跟紧当前形势。 </p>

			<p> 与词汇列表更新速度相对的，EMAIL和网络论坛上的东西越来越乏味。因为人们不得不用极有限的词去表达广泛的意思，大家都变得寡言少语。就连那些秘密的暗语和联系方式也少了许多；整个网络就象是前些天阿瓦登家里出了问题的暖气片一样：虽然名义上是给人带来温暖的东西，但却变的冰冷、僵硬，让人如坠冰窟。 </p>

			<p> 这一天，阿瓦登从电脑前抬起头来，他看了看窗外迷茫的灰色天空，胸口一阵抽搐，不由得痛苦地咳了一声。他拿起塑料杯，将杯子里的纯净水一饮而尽，杯子丢进同样是塑料质地的垃圾桶里，发出钝钝的撞击声，他觉得自己的脑子也是一团垃圾，举起手敲了敲，果然发出同样钝钝的撞击声。 </p>

			<p> 然后他拿起大衣，戴上墨绿色的护目镜，走出门去。阿瓦登没带便携式的旁观者，那东西已经不需要了，城市里到处都是主动式的旁观者，随时监听是否有违禁词汇的存在。整个纽约现在就象是互联网络一样，被有关部门营造成十分健康。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登这一次外出是有正当理由的，他决定去取消网络论坛服务，这服务已经用不着了，因为无论EMAIL，新闻组，BBS论坛还是其他什么现在全部都变成了一样的东西。 </p>

			<p> 从日历来说现在应该是春季，但外面还是很冷，高大的灰色建筑矗立在平地上，仿佛绝对零度下的石林。大团大团的风裹着黄沙与废气穿行其间，风沙无处不在，让人置身其中而难以摆脱。阿瓦登把手揣进兜里，脖子缩进领口，畏缩着向网络部的大楼走去。 </p>

			<p> 忽然，他停下了脚步，惊讶地站在原地无法动弹。他看到阿尔特弥斯正站在前面的路灯下，穿着黑色的制服。可是她的变化有多么大啊，面容象是老了十岁，满脸都是衰老的皱纹，年轻的活力荡然无存；她听到脚步声，转过头来，两个乌黑的大眼睛显得异常空洞，目光越过阿瓦登延伸到远方，没有一个明晰的焦点。 </p>

			<p> 阿瓦登万万没有想到会在这个时间这个地点碰到她，这让他已经沉寂已久的心灵泛起了几点火花，可惜他迟钝的神经已经无法表达出"激动"这一个简单的情感了。两个人互相对视了一阵，他终于木然走到她身边，张了张嘴唇，想对她说些什么。但是他掏出今天新发布的健康词汇列表，发现上面是一片空白--终于连最后一个词组也被有关部门屏蔽了。 </p>

			<p> 于是阿瓦登只好保持着沉默，默默地与面无表情的她擦肩而过，继续向前走去。他的身影逐渐融入同样安静的灰色人群之中，整个城市都显得寂静极了。 </p>

			<h2>The City of Silence</h2>

			<p> The year was 2046; the place, the Capital of the State. </p>

			<p> The State needed no name because, other than it, there were no states. It was just like the Department of Propaganda kept on emphasizing: there are no other states besides the State, and It is who It is, It has always been and always will be. </p>

			<p> When the phone rang, Arvardan was sleeping with his face on the desk in front of the computer. The ringing was insistent, sharp. He rubbed his dry eyes and got up unwillingly. His brain felt heavy and slow. </p>

			<p> The room was cramped, the air stagnant. The only window was shut tight. Even if the window were open it would not have helped-the air outside was even murkier. The room was only about thirty meters square. An old army-green cot was in the corner, the serial number painted in white on one leg. Right next to the cot was a computer desk made from thin wooden boards, on top of which sat a pale white computer. </p>

			<p> The phone continued, now on its seventh ring. Arvardan realized that he had no choice but to take the call. </p>

			<p> "Your Web Access Serial, please." The voice on the other end was not in any hurry. Indeed, it contained no emotional content whatsoever because it was generated by a computer. </p>

			<p> "ARVARDAN19842015BNKF." </p>

			<p> Arvardan automatically recited the string of numerals and letters. At the same time, he felt his chest grow even more congested. He did not like these empty electronic voices. Sometimes he thought, wouldn't it be nice if the voice on the phone belonged to a real woman, smooth and mellow? Arvardan knew this was an unrealistic fantasy. But a fantasy like that still relaxed his body for a few seconds. </p>

			<p> "Your application dated October 4th for an account to participate in the BBS discussion forums has been processed. The appropriate authorities have verified that the information you provided was in order. Please come to the processing center within three days with your Personal Identification Card, your Web Access Permit, your Web Access Serial Card, and other relevant documentation. You will receive your account user name and password then." </p>

			<p> "Understood. Thank, you." Arvardan carefully chose his words, pausing between each. </p>

			<p> It was time to get some work done. Arvardan sat down in front of the computer and moved the mouse. With a faint electronic pop the screen came alive: "Please enter your Web Access Serial and name." Arvardan entered the requested information. Immediately the indicator LEDs on the front of the computer case began to blink rapidly, accompanied by the low hum of spinning fans. </p>

			<p> Every Web user had a Web Access Serial, without which it was impossible to access the Web. This was the only representation of a user on the Web: it could not be changed or deleted. There was a homomorphism between the Web Access Serials and the names on the Personal Identification Cards that everyone carried. Thus, ARVARDAN19842015BNKF was Arvardan and Arvardan was ARVARDAN19842015BNKF. Arvardan knew that some people with poor memories would print their Web Access Serials on the backs of their shirts. </p>

			<p> The appropriate authorities explained that the Real ID Web Access System was designed to make administration of the Web more convenient and rational, and eliminate the serious problems caused by anonymity on the Web. Arvardan was unsure what these "serious problems" were. He had never personally used the Web anonymously, and he knew no one who had-indeed, from a technical perspective, it was impossible for anyone to disguise himself on the Web. The appropriate authorities had given this careful thought. </p>

			<p> "The appropriate authorities" was a semantically vague phrase that nonetheless was full of authority and the power to intimidate. It was simultaneously general and specific, and included within its meaning a broad range of references. Sometimes, it referred to the State Web Administration Committee, which had issued the Web Access Serial to Arvardan. Other times, it referred to the server that emailed Arvardan the latest Web access announcements and regulations. Yet other times, it referred to the Web Investigation Section of the Department of Public Security. Still other times, it referred to the State News Agency. The "appropriate authorities" were everywhere and responsible for everything. They would always appear at the appropriate time to guide, supervise, or warn. </p>

			<p> Now that the Web was almost equivalent to daily life, it was necessary to be ever vigilant and not allow the Web to become a tool for conspirators seeking to destabilize the State-so said the appropriate authorities. </p>

			<p> The computer continued to hum. Arvardan knew this was going to take some time. The computer was issued to him by the appropriate authorities, and he was uncertain about its technical specs and hardware configuration. The case was welded shut and could not be opened. </p>

			<p> While waiting, Arvardan ferreted out a plastic cup from the mountain of trash at his feet and filled it with distilled water from the drinking spigot at his side. He swallowed a painkiller with the water. The distilled water went down his throat and settled into his stomach. The empty taste nauseated him. </p>

			<p> The speakers on the computer suddenly began to play the national anthem. Arvardan put down the cup and refocused his eyes on the computer screen. This meant that he had signed on to the Web. The screen first displayed a notice from the appropriate authorities: plain white background, black text, 14-point font. The notice described the meaning of using the Web and the latest regulations concerning such use. </p>

			<p> The notice quickly disappeared. What followed was a desktop background emblazoned with the slogan: "Let us build a healthy and stable Web!" Another window slowly floated up, containing several links: work, entertainment, email, and BBS discussion forums. The BBS link was grayed out, indicating that choice was not yet available to him. </p>

			<p> The operating system was simple and clear. The browser had no place to enter an URL. Only the bookmarks menu, which was uneditable, contained the addresses for a few Web sites. The reason for this was simple: all of these Web sites were healthy and positive. If other Web sites had the same content as these, then, logically, having access to these Web sites alone was sufficient. On the other hand, if other sites had different content, then, logically, those other sites must be unhealthy and vulgar and should not be accessed. </p>

			<p> Some said that outside the borders of the State there were other Web sites, but those were only urban legends. </p>

			<p> Arvardan first clicked "work." The screen displayed a menu of Web sites and software related to his work. </p>

			<p> As a programmer, Arvardan's daily duty consisted of writing programs in accordance with instructions from his superiors. The work was boring, but it guaranteed a steady income. He did not know what the source code he wrote would be used for. His superiors never gave him such information. </p>

			<p> He tried to continue the work left over from yesterday, but he soon felt he couldn't concentrate. He tried to entertain himself, but the "entertainment" link only contained Solitaire and Minesweeper. According to the appropriate authorities, these two games were healthy: there was no violence and no sex, and they would not give players criminal desires. </p>

			<p> A system alert popped up: "You have new mail." Arvardan had finally found a reason to pause in his work. He quickly moved the cursor onto the "email" link, clicked, and soon a new window appeared on the screen. </p>

			<p> To: ARVARDAN19842015BNKF </p>
			From: WANGHENG10045687XHDI
			Subject: Module/Already/Complete, Start/Current/Project?

			<p> WANGHENG10045687XHDI was the Serial of a colleague. The body of the email was written with a series of individual words and certain fixed expressions separated by slashes. This was a format suggested by the appropriate authorities. Although modern mainframe computers could now process natural-language digital texts easily, this style of writing was a gesture on the part of the citizen to indicate that he possessed the proper attitude. </p>

			<p> Arvardan sighed. Every time he received a new piece of email, he hoped there would be some fresh stimulus to jolt his nervous system, which was growing duller by the day. On some level, he knew that he would be disappointed each time, but he felt that keeping hope alive at least yielded a few seconds of excitement. It was like his wishing that the voice on the phone would be the smooth and mellow voice of a real woman. If he didn't keep for himself bits of remote, hopeless hope, Arvardan thought he would go mad sooner or later. </p>

			<p> Arvardan clicked "reply," and then opened a text file with the name "List of Healthy Words" in another window. This file contained the words and fixed expressions that the appropriate authorities required every Web user to use. When they wanted to compose emails or use the discussion forums, they must find the appropriate words from this list with which to express themselves. If the filtering software found any Web user using a word not on this list, then the word would be automatically shielded and replaced with the phrase "Please use healthy language." </p>

			<p> "Shielded" was a technical term. A shielded word was forbidden in writing or in speech. Ironically, "shielded" itself was a shielded word. </p>

			<p> The list was updated constantly. Every revision meant that a few more words disappeared from the list. This forced Arvardan to exercise his brain to come up with other words to substitute for the words that were shielded. For example, "movement" used to be allowed, but then the appropriate authorities decided that this was a sensitive word, so Arvardan had to use "change of position" to express the same idea. </p>

			<p> He referred to the list and quickly composed a response similar in style to the email he had received. The List of Healthy Words forced people to compress as much information as possible into the fewest words, and to eliminate all unnecessary flourishes and figures of speech. The resulting compositions were like that cup of distilled water: flavorless. Arvardan sometimes thought that one day he would become as bleached out as the emails and distilled water because he wrote such emails and drank such water. </p>

			<p> Arvardan sent the email but could not save a copy for himself. His computer had no hard drive, and no slots for floppy disks or CDs or even a USB port. Broadband technology had advanced to the point where software applications could be hosted on remote servers, and individual users needed not suffer any speed issues related to remote access. Thus, there was no need for end users to have hard drives or local storage. Every document or program a user wrote, even every movement of the mouse or keystroke, would be automatically transmitted to the public server of the appropriate authorities. This made administration easier. </p>

			<p> After completing the email, Arvardan once again fell back into his anxious, listless mood, which he could not express because "tired," "annoyed," and other negative words were all dangerous words. If someone wrote an email to others to complain about such feelings, the recipients would only get an email full of "Please use healthy language." </p>

			<p> This was Arvardan's life. Today was a little worse than yesterday, but should be a little better than tomorrow. But even this description was imprecise, because Arvardan himself was unclear what constituted "a little better" and what constituted "a little worse." "Better" and "worse" were variables, but his life was a constant, the value of which was "repression." </p>

			<p> Arvardan set aside the mouse, tilted his head back, and gave a long sigh. (At least "sigh" had not yet been shielded.) He wanted to hum a song, but he couldn't remember any songs. Instead, he whistled a few times, but it sounded like a dog with tuberculosis barking, and he had to stop. The appropriate authorities were like specters that filled the whole room, giving him no space. He was like a man stuck in a quagmire: as soon as he opened his mouth, mud flowed in, so that he could not even scream for help. </p>

			<p> He shook his head restlessly a few times, and his eyes happened to fall on the phone. Suddenly, he remembered that he still had to go to the appropriate authorities to finish the application for the BBS permit. He was glad of an opportunity to be temporarily free of the Web. On the Web he was nothing more than the sum of a series of dry numbers and "healthy words." </p>

			<p> Arvardan put on his coat and covered his mouth with a filtering mask. He hesitated for a moment, and then picked up the Listener and put it over his ears. Then he left his room. </p>

			<p> The Capital's streets had few pedestrians. Now that the Web was everywhere, most chores could be done there. Unlike in the primitive past, people no longer needed to go outside the home for the necessities of daily life. The appropriate authorities did not recommend too many outdoor activities, as they caused people to make physical contact with each other, and what happened after that was difficult to control. </p>

			<p> The Listener, a portable language-filtering machine, was designed specifically to prevent that sort of thing. When the wearer said or heard some sensitive word, the Listener automatically gave a warning. Every citizen, before leaving home, must put on this device so they could review and critique their own speech and conversation. When people realized that the Listener was present, they often chose silence. The appropriate authorities were attempting to gradually unify life on the Web and life in the physical world, so that they would be equally healthy. </p>

			<p> It was November, and the icy wind drove clouds across a leaden, oppressive sky. Along both sides of the street, utility poles stretched out in two rows like dead trees. Pedestrians wrapped themselves tightly in black or grey coats, shrinking into themselves so that they appeared as quick-moving black dots. A thin miasma covered the whole Capital. Breathing this air without a filtering mask would be a challenge. </p>

			<p> Has it already been two months since I last left my room? Arvardan thought, as he stood next to the sign for the bus stop. </p>

			<p> A tall man in a blue uniform stood next to Arvardan. He looked suspiciously at Arvardan, wrapped in his black coat. Gradually, he shuffled closer, and, with pretended casualness, said to Arvardan: </p>

			<p> "You, have, a, cigarette?" </p>

			<p> The man enunciated each word, and paused half a second between them. The Listener was not yet sufficiently advanced to adjust to the unique rhythm and intonation of each person. In response, the appropriate authorities required that all citizens speak in this manner, so that it would be more convenient to check if anyone used words outside the regulations. </p>

			<p> Arvardan gave him a quick glance, licked his own dry lips, and replied: </p>

			<p> "No." </p>

			<p> The man was disappointed. Unwilling to give up, he opened his mouth again: </p>

			<p> "You, have, a, drink?" </p>

			<p> "No." </p>

			<p> It had been a long time since Arvardan had had any cigarettes or liquor. Perhaps it was due to the shortages, a common problem. But something was amiss: Arvardan's Listener had not issued a warning. In Arvardan's experience, whenever supplies of cigarettes, liquor, or other necessities suffered shortages, these words would temporarily become sensitive words that had to be shielded until the supply could be restored. </p>

			<p> The man seemed exhausted. His puffy red eyes were a common sight these days, a result of long hours spent on the Web. His hair was a mess, and a few days' growth of stubble surrounded his mouth. A strong moldy smell dissipated from the collar of the shirt under his uniform. It was obvious that he had not been outside for days. </p>

			<p> It was only now that Arvardan realized that the man's ears were unadorned. The space where the silver-grey Listener should have been was empty. Arvardan was stunned, and for a moment he did not know whether to remind the man or pretend that he hadn't noticed. He thought, perhaps it would be better to report this to the appropriate authorities. </p>

			<p> Now the man inched even closer, and desire and yearning radiated from his eyes. Arvardan's heart squeezed tight, and unconsciously he took a step back. Was he going to get mugged? Or maybe this man was a sex maniac who had repressed his desires for too long? The man suddenly grabbed his sleeve. Arvardan struggled awkwardly but could not pull himself free. The man did not make another move, but gave a loud yelp, and began to speak to Arvardan in a rapid manner that Arvardan was no longer accustomed to. </p>

			<p> "I just want to talk to you, just a few sentences. I haven't spoken in so long. My name is Hiroshi Watanabe. I'm thirty-two years old. Remember, thirty-two. I've always dreamed of having a house by a lake, with a small boat and a fishing pole. I hate the Web. Down with the Web Regulators! My wife has been poisoned by the Web. She only calls me by my Web Access Serial. This whole city is an asylum, and in it the stronger inmates govern the weaker inmates, and turn all the sane people into madmen like themselves. Fuck 'sensitive words.' I've fucking had it..." </p>

			<p> The man's words poured out of him like soda from a bottle that had been shaken and the cap then popped. Arvardan's Listener beeped continuously. He stared in amazement but had no idea how to respond. Even more worrisome, he discovered in himself a sense of sympathy for the man, the sort of sympathy people who suffered from the same disease had for each other. The man had now gone from complaining to simply cursing, the most raw, direct kind of curses that had long been shielded. It had been five or six years since Arvardan himself had last cursed, and even the last time he had heard such language was four years ago. </p>

			<p> But now this man was swearing at him in public, as though he wanted to say every single shielded sensitive word in a single breath. Arvardan's eardrums began to throb with pain from the decibel level and the constant beeping from the Listener. </p>

			<p> Just then, two police vehicles appeared at the end of the street, and, lights flashing all the way, rushed towards the bus stop. </p>

			<p> The man was still swearing when five or six officers in full riot gear rushed over and pushed him to the ground, beating him with their batons. The man kicked with his legs, and words poured out of his mouth even faster, and the curses grew even coarser. One of the officers pulled out a roll of tape, and with a sharp "pa" tore off a piece which he stuck over the man's mouth. Immediately before his mouth was taped, the man raised his voice, and heartily yelled at the policeman, "Fuck you, you sonovabitch!" Arvardan watched as his expression turned from madness to a contented smile, as though he was intoxicated with the pleasure and release brought about by the swearwords. </p>

			<p> The police scrambled to push the man into one of the cars. One of the officers came to Arvardan. "Is, he, your, friend?" </p>

			<p> "I, do, not, know, him," Arvardan responded in the same way. </p>

			<p> The policeman stared at him. He took down Arvardan's Listener and checked its records. There was no record of Arvardan using any sensitive words. He put the Listener back on Arvardan's ears and warned Arvardan that everything the man had said was extremely reactionary, and he must immediately forget it. Then the officer turned around, and the police left with the arrested man. </p>

			<p> Arvardan sighed with relief. Just now he had, for a second, an impulse to scream at the top of his lungs on this empty street, "Fuck you, you sonovabitch!" </p>

			<p> The street quickly returned to its customary quiescence. Ten minutes later, a bus slowly arrived at the station. The rusty doors opened with a clang, and an electronic female voice filled the empty space inside the bus: </p>

			<p> "Passengers, please pay attention and use civilized language. Adhere strictly to the List of Healthy Words as you speak." </p>

			<p> Arvardan wrapped his coat even tighter around himself. </p>

			<p> About an hour later, the bus arrived at his destination. The cold wind blew in through the broken windows of the bus, frosting Arvardan's breath. The coal dust and sand in the wind stabbed at his face. He got up, shook the dust off himself like a wet dog shaking off water, and left the bus. </p>

			<p> Arvardan needed to go to the appropriate authorities, the Department of Web Security in this case, responsible for processing BBS permit applications. Located across the street from the bus stop, this was a five-story building, cube-shaped, completely covered in grey concrete. If it weren't for the few windows, the building would be indistinguishable from a solid block of concrete: hard and dead. Even mosquitoes and bats stayed away. </p>

			<p> It was also very difficult to obtain a permit to use the BBS forums. An applicant must go through close to twenty procedures and endure a long investigation process before being granted permission to browse the forums. Only after having had permission to browse the forums for three months could one be granted permission to post in designated forums. As for starting your own BBS, that was impossible. </p>

			<p> Despite these obstacles, many used the BBS forums because this was the only place on the Web where one could have some limited conversation. Arvardan had decided to apply for a BBS permit simply out of a vague yet stubborn sense of nostalgia. He didn't know why he wanted to cause so much trouble for himself. Maybe it was just to bring a sense of excitement to his life. Maybe it was to emphasize the bits of connection between himself and the old times. Maybe it was both. </p>

			<p> Arvardan vaguely remembered that when he was a kid, the Web was very different. Not that the technology was different, but the culture. He hoped to remember some of the things from that era through the BBS forums. </p>

			<p> Arvardan walked into the building. Inside it was just as cold as outside, and even darker. There were no lights in the hallways. The walls, painted in a bluish white, were pasted over with Web-related regulations, policies, and slogans. Sucking the cold air into his lungs, Arvardan shuddered. Only the crack round the door at the end of the hall let in a sliver of light. On the door was a sign: "Department of Web Security, BBS Section." </p>

			<p> Arvardan did not dwell on the irony that in order to use some virtual functionality of the Web, one had to physically come here to apply. </p>

			<p> Once he was behind the door, Arvardan immediately felt a blast of hot air. The heat in this room was turned way up, and Arvardan's hands, feet, and face, all frozen numb, now tingled and began to itch. He wanted to reach out and scratch himself. </p>

			<p> An electronic female voice suddenly burst out of the speakers in the ceiling: "Citizen, please remain still as you wait in line." </p>

			<p> Arvardan put down his hand as though he had been given an electric shock, and respectfully waited where he was. He observed the room he was in: a long and narrow lobby, divided in half by a marble counter that rose in the middle like the Great Wall. A fence made of silver-white poles connected the top of the counter to the ceiling. </p>

			<p> "Please proceed to window number eight." </p>

			<p> The counter was so tall that Arvardan could not even look over it to see what was on the other side. But he could hear the sound of someone approaching on the other side then sitting down. </p>

			<p> "Please place your application documents in the tray." </p>

			<p> The speaker on top of the counter issued the order. Unexpectedly, the voice this time was different. Even though it was still dry and cold, Arvardan could tell that the voice did not belong to a computer-this was the voice of a real woman. He tried to lift his head even higher, but he could see nothing. The counter was just too tall. </p>

			<p> "Please put the documents in the tray." </p>

			<p> There was some impatience in the tone when the voice repeated the order. </p>

			<p> Yes, this is the voice of a real woman, Arvardan thought. The electronic female voice was always polite and never had any emotion in it. He put his Personal Identification Card, Web Access Permit, Web Access Serial Card, the record of sensitive word violations, and other similar documentation into a small metallic tray, slid the tray into a slot in the side of the counter, and closed the flap over the slot. Immediately he heard a faint whoosh. He guessed that the person on the other side of the counter-perhaps a woman-had pulled the tray out on her side. </p>

			<p> "What is the purpose for your application for BBS service?" </p>

			<p> The woman's voice from the speaker was business-like and professional. </p>

			<p> "To, increase, Web, related, work, efficiency; to, create, a, healthy, and, stable, Web, environment; to, better, contribute, to, the, motherland." </p>

			<p> Arvardan paused between each word, knowing that this was only a formality. All he had to do was to give the standard answer. </p>

			<p> The other side sank into silence. After about two minutes, the speaker came on again. </p>

			<p> "The final procedure has been completed. You now have permission to use the BBS forums." </p>

			<p> "Thank, you." </p>

			<p> With a bang, the metallic tray bounced back out of the slot. In it, a few more pieces of paper had been added to the documents Arvardan had provided. </p>

			<p> "The appropriate authorities have issued you a user name and password for the BBS service, an index of available forums, a user guide, a copy of the applicable regulations, and the latest List of Healthy Words. Please also check your email inbox." </p>

			<p> Arvardan stepped forward, took out all the things in the tray, and examined them. He was disappointed to see that his BBS user name was identical to his Web Access Serial. He remembered that when he was little it was possible to pick your own BBS forum user name. </p>

			<p> Memories of childhood often were mingled with fairy tales and fantasies, however, and might not match reality. The reality now was that you could only use the user name and password issued by the appropriate authorities. The reason was simple: user names and passwords also could contain sensitive words. </p>

			<p> He shoved the papers in his coat pocket. The pieces of paper were actually meaningless, as the electronic copies have been sent to his email already. But the appropriate authorities felt that formal documents on paper were helpful in inducing in users the proper feelings of fear and respect. </p>

			<p> He hoped that the speaker in the counter would speak a bit more. But he was disappointed by the sound of someone getting up and leaving. Based on the rhythm of the steps, Arvardan was even more certain that the person on the other side was a woman. </p>

			<p> The empty electronic female voice again came from the ceiling: "You have completed the necessary procedures. Please leave the Department of Web Security and return to your work." </p>
			Arvardan wrinkled his nose in disgust, and turned to leave the warm lobby and return to the freezing cold hallway.

			<p> On the way home, Arvardan curled up in his seat on the bus without moving. The success of obtaining permission to use the BBS service gave him an illusory sense of excitement. His right hand fingered the documents in his pocket as he tried to remember the sound of that mysterious woman's voice. </p>

			<p> It would be so nice to hear that voice again. At the same time he rubbed his thumb lightly over the piece of paper on top of the stack in his pocket, imagining that this document had been touched also by her slender, graceful, ivory-like fingers. He was so excited that he wanted to yell, "Fuck you, you sonovabitch!" The sound of that man cursing was stuck in his mind, and again and again the curse rose to the tip of his tongue. </p>

			<p> Suddenly, his finger felt something out of place on the back of the document. Arvardan looked around him, ascertained that there were no other passengers, and carefully took the document out and flipped it over. He examined it carefully in the light from the bus window. </p>

			<p> Arvardan realized that the top right corner of the document had been lightly creased by a fingernail. The crease was so light that if Arvardan hadn't been fingering it so closely he never would have noticed it. The crease was unusual: it was a straight line, but at the end of the line, not far from it, was another very short crease, as though the person had meant to make a dot. The whole thing looked like an exclamation point, or, if you looked at it from the opposite direction, the letter "i." </p>

			<p> He looked through the other papers, and soon discovered that the other four documents also had similar creases. They were shaped differently, but all seemed to be symbols of some sort. Arvardan recalled the order in which the woman from the speaker had mentioned the documents, and began to write the symbols found on each document in order on the steamed-up bus window: </p>

			<p> t-i-t-l-e </p>

			<p> Title? </p>

			<p> The bus stopped, and a few passengers got on. Arvardan moved his body to cover the writing on the window. Then, pretending to yawn, he lifted his sleeve and erased the letters. </p>
			Arriving home, Arvardan took off his coat and filtering mask, and threw the Listener on the cot. Then he fell onto the cot and buried his head in the pillows. Every time he left home to go outside he felt so exhausted afterward, in part because his weakened physique was no longer used to being outside and in part due to the stress of being with the Listener.

			<p> When he woke up, he checked his email. His inbox contained two work-related emails from colleagues and five emails containing the electronic copies of the BBS documents from the Department of Web Security. </p>

			<p> Arvardan opened the index of BBS forums. All the forums were officially sanctioned. The forums had different subjects, but all basically revolved around how to better cooperate and respond to State directives and how to build a healthy Web. For example, on one of the computer technology forums, the main topic was how to improve the technology for shielding sensitive words. </p>

			<p> Amazingly, one of the forums was about games. In it, the main topic of discussion was an online game about how to help others use healthy words. The player could control a little boy to patrol the streets and see if anyone was using sensitive words. If so, the little boy could choose to go up and criticize the offender or report the offender to the police. The more offenders the little boy caught, the higher the score and the better the rewards. </p>

			<p> Arvardan opened a few other random forums. Everyone in them was polite, and spoke very healthy language, just like people outside on the streets. No, it was even worse than on the streets. People on the streets at least had opportunities to perform a few private gestures, like how Arvardan had written "title" on the bus window in secret. But on the BBS forums, even the last bits of privacy of the individual were stripped away. The appropriate authorities could examine every mouse movement, every keystroke, every bit that passed through your computer, and there was nowhere to hide. </p>

			<p> Disappointment and a sense of loss overwhelmed Arvardan. He closed his eyes and lay back. He had been so naive to think that the BBS forums might be a little more open, but now it was clear that it was even more suffocating than real life. He was stuck in an electronic quagmire, and he couldn't breathe. "Fuck you, you sonovabitch" once again rose to the tip of his tongue. The urge to shout was so strong that he struggled to contain himself. </p>

			<p> Suddenly, he thought of the mysterious "title." What did that really mean? Five documents, five emails. Maybe the emails had something hidden in them? Perhaps they had something to do with "title"? </p>

			<p> Arvardan turned back to the screen and carefully examined the five emails from the Department of Web Security. He opened the emails and saw that each one had a title in larger font at the top. He arranged the titles in the order indicated by the letters in the word "title," taking each creased letter as indicating the position its corresponding email's title should be in. </p>

			<p> "Navigate/With/Care:/Your/User/Name/And/Password" </p>
			"To/Our/Users:/Newest/Index/Of/Available/Forums"
			"User/Basics:/Guide/For/New/BBS/Users"
			"Education/In/Health/And/Responsibility:/Applicable/BBS/Regulations"
			"Forum/Etiquette:/List/Of/Healthy/Words/For/The/Web"

			<p> The first word from each title, when put together, formed a sentence: "Navigate To User Education Forum." </p>

			<p> Arvardan remembered that just now he had indeed seen a forum with the name "User Education Forum." He clicked the link for that forum, hoping that this was not just some coincidence. </p>

			<p> The User Education Forum was an administrative forum. All the posts in it were suggestions or complaints about BBS management. The forum moderator was someone named MICHEAL19387465LLKQ. There were few posts and responses, and the forum had little traffic. Arvardan opened the index of all posts in the forum and clicked open each one. The posts seemed completely random, and he could see no pattern. </p>

			<p> Arvardan was disappointed. He seemed to have hit another dead end. But he had not been this excited for so long. He stubbornly kept on staring at the screen, trying to hold onto the sense of discovery and excitement, even if illusory, for just a little while longer. </p>

			<p> Suddenly, his eyes focused on the user name of the forum administrator. MICHEAL was not the usual spelling for MICHAEL. </p>

			<p> He clicked through the posts in the forum again, and noticed that some of the posts were also posted by user names containing unusual spellings for common names. </p>

			<p> Following the pattern from before, he took the initial words from the titles of posts by users with unusually spelled names and arranged them in the order of the number portion of the authors' user names to form a new sentence: </p>

			<p> "Every Sunday at the Simpson Tower, fifth floor, suite B." </p>

			<p> There must be some meaning in this. The documents, the emails, and now the forum posts: three times in a row he had put clues together that led to more clues. This was no mere coincidence. Who had hidden these messages in the official documents from the appropriate authorities? What happened every Sunday at the Simpson Tower, fifth floor, suite B? </p>

			<p> Arvardan had finally found the excitement long absent from his life. The novelty of the unknown stimulated his long-numbed nerves. More important, these word games, planted in the middle of official documents from the appropriate authorities, gave him the satisfaction of breathing freely, as though a solid iron mask had been punched through with a few air holes. </p>

			<p> Let us build a healthy and stable Web! </p>

			<p> Fuck you, you sonovabitch! </p>

			<p> Arvardan stared at the desktop background on the computer screen, mouthed the curse silently, and lifted his middle finger to the screen. </p>

			<p> For the next few days, Arvardan lived in a state of constant, barely subdued excitement. He was like a kid who was trying to hide a mouthful of candy with an innocent smile, and who, after the adults had turned away, broke into a sly grin, enjoying the feeling of having a secret. </p>

			<p> Day after day passed; the List of Healthy Words continued to shrink; the air outside the window grew even murkier. This was the way life was. Arvardan had begun to use the List of Healthy Words as a calendar. If three words had been deleted, that meant three days had passed. When seven words had been deleted, Arvardan knew it was Sunday. </p>

			<p> Arvardan arrived at the Simpson Tower at noon. The clue that had brought him there did not mention a specific time. Arvardan thought it probably made sense to show up around noon. As he arrived, wearing his dark green army coat, the filtering mask, and the Listener, his heart began to beat irregularly. He had imagined all kinds of possibilities for this moment, and now that the secret to the mystery was about to be revealed, he was nervous. No matter what happens here, it can't be worse than my life now, Arvardan thought. </p>

			<p> He walked into the building, and noticed that there were very few people here as well. The empty halls were filled only with his steps and their echo. An old elevator car had advertisements for "Let's build a beautiful home on the Web," and a poster with a man whose face was imbued with truth and justice. The background of the poster was the Flag, and the man pointed at the viewer with his right index finger. Above him was the slogan: "Citizen, I need you to use healthy language." Arvardan turned away, and saw that the other wall of the elevator car had the exact same poster. There was nowhere to hide. </p>

			<p> Luckily, by then he had arrived at the fifth floor. The elevator doors opened, and opposite was the door to suite B. The door was green, the paint chipped, and splats of ink covered the door frame. </p>

			<p> Arvardan took a deep breath, and pressed the doorbell. </p>

			<p> Arvardan thought the rhythm of the steps within the door sounded familiar, as though he had heard it somewhere. The door cracked open halfway, and a young woman held onto the doorknob as she filled the doorway, leaning forward to stare at Arvardan. She said, suspiciously: </p>

			<p> "Who, are, you, looking, for?" </p>

			<p> It was the voice behind the counter at the Department of Web Security, BBS Section. She looked beautiful: hunter-green wool sweater, hair worn short in a tight bun in the typical style, skin so fair it was pale, and lips glowing with the flush of health. </p>

			<p> Looking into the woman's eyes, Arvardan hesitated, and then raised his right hand: "Title." </p>

			<p> Arvardan stared at the woman tensely. If the woman reported his strange behavior to the police, then he would be arrested and interrogated as to why he had gone to a stranger's home. The crime of "willfully lolling about" was only slightly less serious than the crime of "using sensitive words." </p>

			<p> The woman nodded, barely perceptibly, and carefully gestured with her right hand for him to come in. Arvardan was about to speak, but the woman glared at him, and he swallowed and obediently followed her into the apartment. </p>

			<p> Once they were in, the woman shut the door immediately, and then pulled a lead-grey curtain over the doorway. Arvardan blinked anxiously, and looked about him. The apartment had two bedrooms and a living room. The living room had a couch and a coffee table, on top of which there were a few bunches of red and purple plastic flowers. Next to one of the walls was a desk with a computer. A common white wall calendar hung on the wall, but the owner had taken care to decorate its edges with pink paper, giving it a homier feel. Arvardan noticed that the shoe rack next to the door held four pairs of shoes, all of different sizes. This meant that he wasn't the only guest here today. </p>

			<p> Arvardan was still uneasy. Suddenly the woman clapped him lightly on the back, indicating that he should continue inside. The two of them went across the living room, through a short hallway, and arrived at a bedroom. The bedroom door was curtained by the same kind of lead-grey curtain. The woman lifted the curtain and pushed open the bedroom door. </p>

			<p> Arvardan saw three smiling individuals in a room decorated with real, fresh flowers. The room was also full of many other antiques that existed only in Arvardan's memory: an Impressionist painting, a wooden sculpture from Uganda, and a silver candelabra. But there was no computer. </p>

			<p> As he hesitated, the woman entered the room. She carefully pulled the curtain closed and shut the door. She turned around: </p>

			<p> "Welcome to the Talking Club!" </p>

			<p> The Talking Club? </p>

			<p> Out of habit, Arvardan did not say the words aloud. He wasn't certain if the words were healthy, and so asked his question only with his eyes. </p>

			<p> "You can speak as freely as you like in here. This damned device won't work here." The woman pointed to his Listener. There was no warning beep. It didn't seem to hear the two sensitive words in her speech: "freely" and "damned." </p>

			<p> Arvardan remembered the man he had seen a week ago at the bus stop. If he took off his Listener, would what happened to that man also happen to him? The woman saw that he was hesitant. She pointed to the lead-grey curtain at the door: "Don't worry. This can shield off the signal for the Listener. No one will know." </p>

			<p> "Who, are, you? What, is, this, place?" </p>

			<p> Arvardan took off the Listener. He spoke in a low voice. It was still too difficult for him to shift out of the manner of speech demanded by the appropriate authorities. </p>

			<p> "This is the Talking Club. Here, you may speak as you like," said another man as he got up. He was tall and thin, the glasses over his nose particularly thick. </p>

			<p> Arvardan mumbled, but could not speak out loud. He was embarrassed by the stares of the four others, and his face flushed bright red. The woman who had opened the door for him gave him a sympathetic look: "You poor thing. Don't be so tense. Everyone is like this when they first arrive. Over time you'll get used to it." </p>

			<p> She put a hand on Arvardan's shoulder: "Actually, we've met. At least I've seen you, but you haven't seen me." As she spoke, she reached up and let down her hair. The black tresses fell to her shoulders, and in that moment Arvardan thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. </p>

			<p> Arvardan finally spoke a whole sentence, though the words still did not flow smoothly. "I...remember you, remember your voice." </p>

			<p> "Really?" The woman laughed. She sat him on a couch, and handed him a glass of water. Arvardan noticed that this was an old-fashioned glass, etched with a flowery pattern. The water inside the glass gave off a faint fragrance. Arvardan tried a sip. The sweet taste was particularly stimulating for a tongue that had grown used to distilled water. </p>

			<p> "This wasn't easy to obtain. Even we can't get it every week." The woman sat next to him, looking intently at him with her dark eyes. "How did you find out about us?" </p>

			<p> Arvardan explained the process by which he had discovered the sequence of clues. The other four nodded in approval. </p>

			<p> "Smart man. Your brain hasn't become mush," said a thirty-something man with a few extra pounds. His voice was very loud. </p>

			<p> The middle-aged man with glasses put his hands together in a gesture of agreement. "You are a natural for membership in the Talking Club." </p>

			<p> "Alright," the fat man said, "let's give a round of applause to formally welcome the new member." </p>

			<p> The other four applauded, and the sound of their clapping filled the small bedroom. Arvardan lifted the glass to them, embarrassed. When the applause died down, he timidly lifted his head, and asked, "Can I ask a question? What exactly is the Talking Club?" </p>

			<p> The woman who had brought him in responded: </p>

			<p> "The Talking Club is a gathering where we can say anything we want. There are no sensitive words here, and no healthy Web. This is a space to release your soul and stretch out your body." </p>

			<p> "Our principle is just this: talk," added the middle-aged man, and he adjusted his glasses. </p>

			<p> "But, what can I talk about?" </p>

			<p> "Anything. You can talk about anything in your heart." The middle-aged man smiled. </p>

			<p> This is an audacious gathering. It's clearly criminal, Arvardan thought. But he found himself attracted to the idea of being a criminal in this way. </p>

			<p> "Of course, we need to make certain things clear," the woman said. "Talking is dangerous. Every member faces the danger of arrest by the appropriate authorities. State agents may break through the door at any moment, and capture us under the charges of illegal assembly and using illegal language. You have the right to refuse to join us, and leave immediately." </p>

			<p> Arvardan listened to the woman's warning. He hesitated. But he thought that if he left now, then he would go back to his life, suffocating in a quagmire. Arvardan had not known he had such a strong yearning to talk. </p>

			<p> "I will not leave. I will join you, talking." </p>

			<p> "Perfect! Oh, why don't we start with self-introductions?" The woman was delighted. She stood up. "Let's start with me. My name is Artemis. As for my Web Access Serial? To hell with it. Who cares? I have my own name." </p>

			<p> Her words made everyone, including Arvardan, laugh. Then she continued. "Still, Artemis is just a pseudonym. She's a goddess from Greek mythology." </p>

			<p> "Pseudonym?" </p>

			<p> "Right. It's not the same as the name on my Personal Identification Card." </p>

			<p> "But, why?" </p>

			<p> "Aren't you sick of the name they have for you in their files? I want to give myself a name that I like, even if there's just one place to use it. In the Talking Club we each have picked a name for ourselves. That's how we address one another." </p>

			<p> Arvardan nodded thoughtfully. He understood Artemis's feeling. When using the BBS forums, he had hoped to pick a name that he liked, and not be assigned a user name. </p>

			<p> Through Artemis's self-introduction, Arvardan learned that she was a staffer at the Department of Web Security, BBS Section. She was twenty-three, single, and hated cockroaches and spiders. Her hobbies included sewing and gardening, and the flowers in the bedroom were secretly cut and brought back by her from outside the Capital. </p>

			<p> Next was the middle-aged man. His name was Lancelot. He was forty-one, an engineer at the Capital Electric Plant. The name "Lancelot" came from the Arthurian legends, and belonged to a faithful knight. Lancelot was married and had two children: a boy (aged three) and a girl (aged four). They liked lemon-flavored candy the most. Lancelot hoped he would be able to bring the kids to the next gathering of the Club. The children were still learning to talk, and he wanted them to learn real speech. </p>

			<p> The thirty-something overweight man was a Web Regulator for the Department of Web Security, named Wagner. This surprised Arvardan. He had had the impression that Web Regulators were all cold, expressionless men, but the man before Arvardan was corpuscular, oily, and his mustache curled up spiritedly at the ends. He loved cigars and the opera, and took advantage of the special privileges available to Web Regulators to obtain them. </p>

			<p> "Wagner got us the curtains that can shield the signals from the Listener," Artemis added. Wagner tipped an imaginary hat and bowed to her. </p>

			<p> The fourth member of the Talking Club was a woman in a black uniform. She had just turned thirty. Her name was Duras, and she worked as an editor at the Capital Daily Times. She was even thinner than Artemis, and her high cheeks contrasted with her sunken eyes. Her thin lips didn't part much from each other even when she spoke, and never revealed her teeth. She liked cats and dogs, even though she had no pets now. </p>

			<p> "It's you next," Artemis said to Arvardan. Arvardan took a minute to think, and then introduced himself to the group, stammering many times. When he tried to describe his hobbies, for a moment he couldn't think of any. He had never had to think about hobbies before. </p>

			<p> Artemis put her hand on his shoulder again, and tried to help him. "Well, what's the one thing you really want to do?" </p>

			<p> "I can really say anything?" </p>

			<p> "Anything. There are no restrictions here." </p>

			<p> Arvardan thought that he had finally found an opportunity. He cleared his throat, scratched his head, and broke into a loud, crisp shout: "Fuck you, you sonovabitch!" </p>

			<p> All the others were stunned. Wagner was the first to recover. He held onto his cigar with his teeth and applauded vigorously. Then he took the cigar in his hand, and loudly exclaimed: "Fantastic! This should be our formal membership oath." </p>

			<p> Artemis and Duras both giggled. Arvardan thought that, beyond the novelty of speaking with the Club, he really enjoyed the sense of contempt for the appropriate authorities in voicing the string of swearwords. </p>

			<p> Artemis tilted her head and asked him, "What do you wish to name yourself?" </p>

			<p> "Ummm...Wang Er," Arvardan said. This was a Chinese name. He had once had a Chinese friend who loved to tell stories. In all his stories, the main character was named Wang Er. </p>

			<p> The mood in the bedroom was now friendly and easy, and conversation became more natural. Everyone got into a comfortable position, and Artemis refilled everyone's cup from a kettle from time to time. Arvardan gradually let go of his tension, and felt that his brain had never been so relaxed. </p>

			<p> Artemis filled his cup with sweet water again, "It's impossible to speak freely in our daily lives. We need this space. But we can't openly advertise for membership, and it's far too risky to try to find new members through physical contact. So Lancelot designed a system of clues and hints, and Wagner and I used our system access privileges to leave the clues in places. Only those who discovered and solved the clues would find the Club." </p>

			<p> "My system wasn't designed just for safety," Lancelot said. He took off his glasses and carefully polished them. "It's also a qualifying exam for potential new members. Members of the Talking Club must be in possession of intelligence and wisdom, passionate, and full of yearning for freedom." </p>

			<p> Wagner held his cigar between two fingers, flicked the ash into an ashtray, then said loudly, "In my experience, most applicants for permission to use the BBS service are nostalgic for the past or desire something new and fresh in their lives. They think that the BBS forums will show them something different from daily life-of course, reality is far otherwise since the State's control over the BBS forums is even stricter than the regulation of email-but their desire indicates that they want to be free. Thus, we hide our clues in the BBS documents so that only applicants for BBS service can find them. And only those who are smart and observant can find all the hints and follow their trail to find this place." </p>

			<p> "You are the second person to find the Talking Club. The first was Miss Duras," Artemis said to Arvardan. Arvardan gazed at Duras in admiration. Duras lightly said, "It's no big deal. My job is all about playing with words." </p>

			<p> Arvardan remembered the crazy man he had met at the bus stop a week ago. He told the others his story. When he was finished, Lancelot shook his head, and sighed. </p>

			<p> "I've seen this sort of thing too. It happened to a colleague of mine. This shows the necessity for something like the Talking Club as a pressure-release valve. Living constantly under the restrictions imposed by sensitive words will drive people crazy because they can neither think nor express themselves." </p>

			<p> Wagner moved his heavy body to the side. "This is exactly what the appropriate authorities want to see. Then only the stupid will survive. A society full of stupid men is a stable one." </p>

			<p> "You are also a member of the appropriate authorities, Mr. Wagner," Artemis said lightly as she refilled Wagner's cup. </p>

			<p> "Miss Artemis, I'm an ordinary man just like any other, with the sole distinction that I'm allowed to use a few more sensitive words." </p>

			<p> Everyone laughed. Arvardan had never seen so many people speak so much. He found, to his own surprise, that he quickly felt at home among these people. The distance and sense of unfamiliarity between them melted away quickly. Also, his dizziness and congested chest, problems that had become habits, disappeared. </p>

			<p> Quickly the topic of conversation turned from the Talking Club itself to broader interests. Artemis sang a song; Lancelot told a few jokes; Duras told everyone about the customs of the southern provinces of the State; Wagner even sang an aria from an opera. Even though Arvardan couldn't understand a word of this last contribution, he did not hold back his applause. In a shielded corner of the Capital, five individuals unwilling to sink into silence were enjoying a most precious luxury-talking. </p>

			<p> "Wang Er, do you know Nineteen Eighty-Four?" Artemis asked. She sat down next to Arvardan. </p>

			<p> Arvardan shook his head. "I only know that nineteen eighty-four is part of my Web Access Serial." </p>

			<p> "It's a book." </p>

			<p> "Book?" This was an old word. Now that computer technology had advanced to the point that all information was contained by the Web, anyone could go to the online library to get the digital editions of published material. The appropriate authorities considered physical books to be an unnecessary waste, and they had gradually disappeared. </p>

			<p> Wagner said, "It is understandable that the appropriate authorities prefer electronic books. With electronic books, all you need is FIND and REPLACE to eliminate all unhealthy words in a book and decontaminate it. But to correct and edit physical books would take forever." </p>

			<p> "Nineteen Eighty-Four is a great book. It's what an old philosopher predicted about our modern world," Artemis said earnestly. "Long ago, the book perceived the struggle between restraint and freedom over the flesh and over the soul. It's the foundation of the Talking Club." </p>

			<p> "How can one read this book?" Arvardan asked, staring into Artemis's dark eyes. </p>

			<p> "We can't find a paper copy, and of course the online library won't have it." Lancelot shook his head, and then broke into another smile. He gestured with his left hand at Duras. "Our Miss Duras should be proud of her memory. When she was young, she was fortunate enough to have read this book, and could recall most of it." </p>

			<p> "Wonderful! Then she wrote it out, right?" </p>

			<p> "That would be far too dangerous. Right now, owning physical books is a great crime, and would risk exposing the Talking Club. Instead, every time the Talking Club meets, we ask Miss Duras to recite some of it." </p>

			<p> Everyone quieted. Duras stood up and walked to the middle of the room. Arvardan casually put his arm around Artemis's shoulders, and she leaned towards him, her hair drifting between them. A faint feminine fragrance found its way to his nose and caused his heart to skip a few beats. </p>

			<p> Duras's voice was not loud, but clear and forceful. Her memory was indeed amazing: not only did she remember the plot, but she could even recount many of the details and recite entire passages verbatim. Duras got to the part where Julia pretended to fall and secretly handed a note with the words "I love you" to Winston. Duras's retelling was so lively that she captivated everyone. Artemis was especially absorbed in the story, and didn't notice Arvardan's eyes, which never left her. </p>

			<p> "The author of Nineteen Eighty-Four predicted the progress of totalitarianism, but could not predict the progress of technology." Wagner gave his opinion as Duras paused for a drink. Arvardan thought that Wagner's appearance belied his quickness: he was a very perceptive technocrat. </p>

			<p> "In Oceania, it was still possible to pass secret notes to each other and express one's hidden thoughts. But now things are different. The appropriate authorities have forced all of us to live on the Web, where even if we wanted to pass secret notes to each other the Web Regulators would see everything. There is no place to hide. And in real life? We still have to contend with the Listener." Wagner knocked his cigar against his thighs. "To put it simply: technology is neutral. But the progress of technology will cause a free world to become ever freer, and a totalitarian world to become ever more repressive." </p>

			<p> "This seems like the pronouncement of some philosopher," Artemis said, winking at Arvardan. She retrieved some cookies from a drawer and handed them to everyone. </p>

			<p> "Isn't this just like how the bits are just 1's and 0's, but some will make them into useful tools, while others will make them into malicious viruses?" Arvardan said. Wagner snapped his fingers happily. "Very good, Wang Er. That's exactly it. You are a credit to programmers." </p>

			<p> Duras looked at the clock hanging on the wall, and reminded the other four that time was up. The Talking Club could not meet for too long each time. The longer their Listeners remained shielded and off the grid, the greater the risk of exposure. </p>

			<p> "All right. Let's take the final half-hour to complete today's activities." </p>

			<p> Artemis cleaned away the empty cups on the table, and Lancelot and Wagner both got up to stretch out their shoulders and backs, a bit sore from sitting for so long. Only Duras remained seated without moving. </p>

			<p> "Activities? What activities?" Arvardan asked. What would the Talking Club do other than talk? </p>

			<p> "Oh, right. We do have other activities." Artemis moved her bangs out of the way, and gave him a seductive smile. "We still have to have frank exchanges with each other." </p>

			<p> "Frank exchanges?" </p>

			<p> "Yes, fucking, to speak plainly." </p>

			<p> Arvardan's face turned white, and his breathing quickened. His stomach felt as if it had just been injected with air chilled to thirty degrees below zero. He couldn't believe his ears. </p>

			<p> Of course, the appropriate authorities did permit sexual activities, but only between married couples. And there was a complex set of algorithms that computed the legally permitted frequency and lengths of their couplings based on the couple's age, physical health, income level, professions, environment, climate, and record of rule-violations. As for unmarried individuals such as Arvardan, it was completely illegal to engage in any sexual activity whatsoever (including masturbation) or to read or view any material related to sex-all immoral words having been eliminated from the List of Healthy Words in any case. </p>

			<p> "The Talking Club has freedom of speech, as well as the freedom to go to bed with anyone," Artemis said without any embarrassment. "We talk to each other, and then choose whoever we like to make love with, just as we choose to speak the words that we like." </p>

			<p> Lancelot saw the awkward expression on Arvardan's face. He walked over and lightly clapped Arvardan's shoulders. He said, gently, "Of course, we won't force anyone. This is all built on the foundation of consenting adults. I still have to leave early to pick up my kids. You have just the right number without me." </p>

			<p> Arvardan's face flushed bright red. He felt hot, like the CPU in his computer during the summer. He couldn't even lift his eyes to look at Artemis. He had desired female company for so long, but this was the first time he had been so close to that goal. </p>

			<p> Lancelot said his goodbyes to everyone. Artemis left the bedroom to Wagner and Duras, and took the hand of Arvardan, who was close to panicking, and led him to another bedroom. This one clearly belonged to Artemis herself. The room was appointed simply, very neat and clean. </p>

			<p> Artemis took the initiative. Under her seductive ministrations, Arvardan gradually let himself go, and allowed the primitive desires hidden deep within his heart to come out. He had yearned for any kind of release from his dry, boxed-in life by imagining the smooth, mellow voice of a real woman, and now his dreams were finally coming true. Arvardan did not know if there was a distinction between his desire for her and his desire to say "Fuck you, you sonovabitch," but now was not the time for analysis. </p>

			<p> When he woke up, he saw that Artemis was lying beside him, her naked body like a white jade statue. Even in sleep, her pose was beautiful. He lifted himself, yawned, and then Artemis opened her eyes. </p>

			<p> "Feels good, doesn't it?" she asked. </p>

			<p> "Yes..." Arvardan didn't know what else to say. He paused, then said hesitantly, "Before, with Lancelot and Wagner, did you also...ummm, what I mean is, like we did just now?" </p>

			<p> "Yes," Artemis said, gently. She sat up, her hair hanging over her shoulder to cover her chest. Her forthrightness confused Arvardan. There was an uncomfortable lull in the room, and then Artemis broke the silence: "You remember the story today? The woman in the story handed the man a note that said, 'I love you.'" </p>

			<p> "Yes," Arvardan said. </p>

			<p> "The word 'love' does not exist in the List of Healthy Words promulgated by the appropriate authorities." Artemis's eyes were filled with regret and loss. </p>

			<p> "I love you," Arvardan said, without thinking. He knew that it was possible to say anything he wanted in this room. </p>

			<p> "Thank you." Artemis gave him a perfunctory smile. She put on her clothes and hurried Arvardan to do the same. Arvardan was a bit disappointed. She had not responded as enthusiastically as he had wished, but as though what he had just said was not all that important. </p>

			<p> By now Duras and Wagner had already left. Artemis walked him to the door, handed him his Listener, and then reminded him, "Once outside, remember not to mention anything about the Talking Club or anyone here. Outside of the Talking Club, we are strangers." </p>

			<p> "I understand," Arvardan said. He turned to leave. </p>

			<p> "Wang Er." </p>

			<p> Arvardan turned at her words. Before he knew what was happening, two soft lips covered his lips, then a low voice sounded by his ear. "Thank you. I love you too." </p>

			<p> Arvardan felt his eyes grow wet. He put on the Listener, opened the door, and walked back into the suffocating world. But now he was in a very different mood from when he had first showed up. </p>

			<p> After this, Arvardan's mental condition clearly improved. He carefully treasured the joy of having a secret club. Every week or two weeks, the five members met. They talked, sang, or listened to Duras tell the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Arvardan enjoyed frank exchanges with Artemis a few more times, and occasionally did the same with Duras. Now he had two personas: one was Arvardan, who existed in real life and on the Web, and the other was Wang Er, member of the Talking Club. </p>

			<p> At one meeting, Arvardan asked, "Are we the only ones who gather to talk in private in the whole State?" </p>

			<p> "It is said that there are some places in the State, far from the Capital and deeply hidden in the mountains, where the truly radical not only gather to talk, but organize for violence. They shout as they rush at the State's agents, and even curse at the firing squads as they are executed," Wagner said. </p>

			<p> "Can we join them?" Arvardan asked. </p>

			<p> "Only if you are willing to give up your safe and still-comfortable life. The radicals live in places so desolate that except for free speech there is nothing else, not even enough clean water," Wagner said, a little coldly. </p>

			<p> Arvardan flinched and did not pursue the topic further. He certainly desired talk, but not to the point where he was willing to give up all that he had, little though it was. Distilled water was still better than no water. The Talking Club provided sufficient nourishment to sustain the dried husk of his spirit. Bottom line: he was easily satisfied. </p>

			<p> At another meeting, the topic of conversation turned to sensitive words. Arvardan remembered that long ago-his memory was growing hazy-the appropriate authorities had actually issued a List of Sensitive Words. People who ran the various Web sites were told to refer to it secretly in administering the sites. He was not sure how that system had evolved into the present one. That day, Wagner brought a bottle of wine for the occasion and was in good spirits. He explained to them the history of the "shielding" system. As a Web Regulator, he had access to the historical records for this process. </p>

			<p> Initially, the State only shielded certain sensitive words, but the State quickly discovered that this was essentially useless. Many simply mixed in special characters or numbers or misspelled words to get around the inspection system. The appropriate authorities had to respond by trying to shield these variant spellings. But, as everyone knew, the combinations of different characters to approximate the appearance of different words were virtually limitless. Provided you had some imagination, it was always possible to come up with a novel combination and get your meaning across. For example, the word "politics" could be written as "polit/cs," "政itics," "pol/itic$," etc., etc. </p>

			<p> After the appropriate authorities finally caught on to the problem, they took a new tack. Since it was not possible to filter out all possible combinations of characters that might spell out a word, the solution was to forbid the use of anything except real dictionary words. This procedure was initially very successful. The number of rule-violators went down significantly. But very soon people discovered it was possible to use puns, homonyms, or rhyming slang to continue to express the same dangerous ideas. Even if the appropriate authorities filtered out all sensitive words and all possible puns and homonyms with those words, it was useless. Imaginative citizens gave their creativity free rein, and used metaphor, metonymy, analogy, etymology, rhyming slang, and other rhetorical tricks to substitute non-sensitive words for sensitive ones. The human mind was far more creative than the computer. The computer might shield off one path, but the people had many more paths to choose from. </p>

			<p> This contest, under the surface, seemed to go the way of the people. But then, a man who could think outside the box appeared. It was unclear who he really was: some said that he was the chief administrator at the appropriate authorities; others said that he was a dangerous man who had been arrested for using too many sensitive words. He was the cause of the turn in the tide of the battle between the State and the people. </p>

			<p> He suggested to the appropriate authorities that the regulations should no longer explain what was forbidden. Instead, the regulations should set forth what could be said, and how to say it. The appropriate authorities immediately took this advice, and issued new regulations. The List of Sensitive Words was eliminated, and in its place was the List of Healthy Words. </p>

			<p> This time, the people were on the losing side. In the past, they had delighted in playing cat-and-mouse games with the appropriate authorities on the Web and in daily life. But now the appropriate authorities had them by the throat, since the entire framework and building blocks of language were now under their control. </p>

			<p> Nonetheless, the people refused to give up. They began to select words from the List of Healthy Words and use them in novel combinations to express illegal meanings. For example, writing "stabilize" twice in a row meant "topple," "stabilize" plus "prosperity" meant "shield." The appropriate authorities had to keep an eye on this sort of trend, and, day after day, eliminate more and more words from the List of Healthy Words to prevent their use in these new roles. </p>

			<p> "So long as the world even contained two words or even two letters, then it would be possible to continue the free exchange of ideas-you know Morse code?" </p>

			<p> Wagner paused, drained his cup, and gave a satisfied burp. </p>

			<p> "But, the price for this war is the loss of language. Our ability to express ourselves continues to get poorer, and more dry and banal. More and more, people will choose silence. But this is a good thing as far as the appropriate authorities are concerned." Lancelot had a worried expression on his face, and rhythmically knocked against the desk. "If you think about it, isn't it the people's desire for freedom the very thing that's pushing language to the edge of death? Ironic, isn't it? The appropriate authorities will have the last laugh." </p>

			<p> "No, no. They will not understand the emotion behind laughter," Wagner said. </p>

			<p> "Actually, I think the appropriate authorities have always operated in a state of fear. They are terrified that people will have the use of too many words, and express too many thoughts, making their control difficult," Artemis put on the stiff, cold expression she wore for work, and imitated the common speech pattern: "Let us build a healthy and stable Web!" </p>

			<p> Duras, Lancelot, and Wagner all burst into laughter. The only one who didn't laugh was Arvardan. He was stuck on the last thing Lancelot had said: in the war between the people and the appropriate authorities, the final conclusion was the death of language. Then the Talking Club was nothing more than a chance to enjoy the brief, final quiet moment that came from pulling shut the curtains on the windows of a train speeding toward the edge of a cliff. </p>

			<p> Duras could not attend the frank exchange phase of the Talking Club that time because it was her time of the month, and she left early. Artemis washed the cups and smiled at the three men: "Should we try a three-on-one?" </p>

			<p> Lancelot patted Arvardan on the shoulder. "I have some things I want to discuss with Wang Er. We'll stay here a bit." Artemis took Wagner to the other bedroom. Arvardan was confused, unsure of what Lancelot wanted. </p>

			<p> Lancelot sat back on the couch. The engineer's expression became serious. "Wagner has told you about the radical organizations?" </p>

			<p> Arvardan nodded. </p>

			<p> "What do you think of them?" </p>

			<p> "I admire them. But I'm not sure if it's necessary to go that far. Men cannot live on words alone." Although Arvardan had never been to the mountains, he had heard plenty about their desolation. </p>

			<p> Lancelot laughed bitterly and drained the coffee cup in front of him. "I was once a member of the radicals. But now I'm a deserter." </p>

			<p> Arvardan stared at him. </p>

			<p> "In the beginning, I had lots of ideals. I went to the mountains and joined them. But when the rush of freedom had passed, what followed was only constant deprivation and suffering. I wavered and finally abandoned my friends, snuck back to the Capital, and now I hide in a girl's bedroom, chat, fuck, and drink coffee, and say I'm satisfied with my life." </p>

			<p> "You regret leaving?" </p>

			<p> "My regret is not what's important." Lancelot handed a piece of paper to him. The paper was thin, light, and had a single address written on it. </p>

			<p> "Memorize it and swallow the paper," Lancelot said. "This is how you get to the mountains and get in touch with them. If you change your mind about your life, you can go any time." </p>

			<p> "Have you given this to the others too?" </p>

			<p> "No. The Talking Club is enough for the rest of us. But something is different about you. You remind me a lot of the younger me. Though you look quiet, inside you there is a dangerous spark. I have lost the ambition and the will to change the world, but I do not want to see everyone become like me." </p>

			<p> "But I-" </p>

			<p> "You don't need to promise me anything. This is only an option, that's all." </p>

			<p> After returning home from the Talking Club, Arvardan lay on his cot with his hands under his head, and sank into thought. He was infatuated with Artemis and could not help himself. Arvardan envied Winston from Duras's telling of Nineteen Eighty-Four. He and Julia had their own room, a world that belonged only to the two of them. </p>

			<p> (He also thought about what Lancelot had said to him about the radicals, but soon he put it out of his mind-the image of radicals hiding in the mountains was simply not as alluring as the body of Artemis.) </p>

			<p> Once, when he was engaging in a "frank exchange" with Artemis, he had revealed his thoughts to her. She didn't answer him directly, but only said that the relationship between them could not go beyond what they had-the limit of what was possible. The appropriate authorities would not be napping forever. "We can only compress our emotional lives into the weekly meetings of the Talking Club. It's already a great luxury," she said, as she gently stroked his chest. "In the Talking Club, we are Artemis and Wang Er. But any other time, you are ARVARDAN19842015BNKF, and I am ALICE19387465BJHD." </p>

			<p> Arvardan could only sigh in response. He really shouldn't have asked for more. </p>

			<p> Along with his emotions, the Web also changed. Ever since he had joined the Talking Club, Arvardan had gradually begun noticing some of the hidden aspects of the Web. Just as Wagner had said, the war between the people and the appropriate authorities never ended. Always, thought and speech leaked from the cracks. </p>

			<p> Arvardan noticed that within the formulaic emails and BBS forum posts were hidden many details that were worth paying attention to, just like his "title." There were all kinds of codes and hidden meanings. These puzzles came from different individuals, and the format and decoding technique differed for each. Arvardan didn't know what was hidden behind some of the codes, but one thing was certain: the Talking Club was not the only underground gathering. Wagner was right: always, individuals were attempting to use "healthy" words to express "unhealthy" thoughts. </p>

			<p> In the past, Arvardan had only vaguely felt that he was being constrained, but now he could see clearly the pulsing arteries and veins of this system, and the various tricks played on him by the appropriate authorities. The freedom that he enjoyed at the Talking Club only made him even more aware of the lack of freedom in his life. </p>

			<p> "Fuck you, you sonovabitch!" </p>

			<p> At every meeting, the three male members would shout this curse out loud. They understood very well that this had no effect on the appropriate authorities, but they loved the feeling the curse brought them. </p>

			<p> One week, Arvardan was particularly busy. His colleague, for unknown reasons, had been shielded. This meant that the whole project fell on his shoulders. The project involved designing a piece of software, for the appropriate authorities, which would be used to control the energy distribution for a new, high-powered, active Listener. (It was unusual for Arvardan to be told this much, but since his colleague was gone, his superiors had to give him the bigger picture.) The software was complex, and he had to spend more than twelve hours a day working in front of the computer, only pausing to eat, take a drink of distilled water, or nap briefly on his cot when his body could no longer take the abuse. His room was filled with the stench of sweaty socks and shirts. </p>

			<p> Coincidentally, the heating system in his room failed. The grey radiators became ice cold and no longer circulated hot water. Arvardan checked them and realized the problem wasn't with the pipes. Since his neighbors were suffering the same fate, it meant that the heating system was failing as a whole. The one positive effect of this failure was that it reduced the stench in his room. The negative effect, however, was that his room turned into an ice cellar. The low temperature covered everything in the already-uncomfortable room with an additional layer of frost. The only source of warmth in the room was the computer. Arvardan put on all his winter clothes, crawled into bed, and pointed the exhaust fans of the computer towards him. </p>

			<p> The appropriate authorities decided that "heat" and "furnace" and other similar words were also temporarily sensitive words, so Arvardan had no way of drafting a complaint to the heating supply agencies. All he could do was to wait quietly. Other than his fingers moving over the keyboard, he tried to remain very still, so as to conserve body heat. On the fourth day after the heating system failed, the radiators finally began to clatter and rattle with the sound of hot water flowing through them. The room warmed up again, and "heat" and "furnace" and similar words returned to the List of Healthy Words. So emails and BBS forum posts were filled with sentiments like "We congratulate the appropriate authorities for restoring heat so quickly to bring warmth to the people in need!" and "The people's government loves the people!" etc. </p>

			<p> But this was too late for Arvardan. He fell sick with a cold, a terrible cold. His head hurt as though someone had shot a dumdum bullet into his skull. All he could do was to lie on his bed and wait for the doctor. The doctor arrived at his home, put him on an IV, gave him some nameless pills, and told him to rest. This sickness lasted several days, and he had to give up that week's Talking Club meeting. His body just wasn't up for it, and Arvardan thought he was going to die. </p>

			<p> Arvardan lay on his bed, filled with regret. The Talking Club was his only joy in life, and now he couldn't even go. He covered his head with his blanket and thought, Would Wagner bring something special to the meeting this time? Would Lancelot bring his two children? And Artemis... If Arvardan weren't there, who would she have a "frank exchange" with? Wagner or Lancelot? He also thought about Duras. At the last meeting, Duras had reached the point in the story where Winston told Julia, in their secret meeting room, "We are the dead." Julia also said, "We are the dead." And a third voice then said, "You are the dead." </p>

			<p> Duras had stopped when she got to this point. Arvardan had desperately wanted to know that happened next. Who was the third voice? Was it the Party? Would Winston and Julia be arrested? What was going to happen to them? </p>

			<p> "Let it be a cliffhanger," Artemis said to him. "Then the whole next week our lives will be spent in the joy of anticipation." And then the two went back to the joy of frankly exchanging. </p>
			Arvardan's sickness lasted ten days before he recovered. The first thing he did after he felt well enough was to get up and look at the calendar on the wall. Today was Sunday, a Talking Club meeting day. Arvardan had missed one meeting, and he felt like a man dying of starvation. Even in his sleep he dreamed of talking at the Talking Club.

			<p> Arvardan washed his face and carefully shaved off his thick stubble with a rusty razor. He brushed his teeth and smoothed down his bed hair with a towel and some warm water. Due to his sickness, the appropriate authorities had issued him some extra supplies, including two croissants, two ginger beers, and a packet of fine sugar. He wrapped these carefully in a plastic bag, and put the package inside his coat pocket to bring to the Talking Club to share with everyone. </p>

			<p> Arvardan got off the bus, felt for the package hidden inside his coat, and walked towards the Simpson Tower. Halfway there, he lifted his head, and an icy chill seized his heart, forcing him to stop in his tracks. </p>

			<p> Something was very wrong. </p>

			<p> He looked up to the fifth floor. Before, the window from Artemis's apartment that faced the street had been covered by pink curtains, but now the curtains were pulled to the sides, and the window was wide open. If there was a meeting of the Talking Club today, Artemis would never have left the shielding curtains open. And keeping the windows open was odd, period. In the Capital, the air outside was terribly murky. No one would have opened the windows to let in "fresh air." </p>

			<p> There was no Talking Club today. Something else was going on. Arvardan stared at the window, and his heart began to beat furiously. He took his hand out of his pocket, put a cigarette in his mouth, then leaned against a utility pole, and forced himself to be calm so as not to raise the suspicion of passing pedestrians. Suddenly he saw something that made him almost faint. A single idea filled his mind. </p>

			<p> "There would be no meeting of the Talking Club this week. There will never be a meeting again," he mumbled to himself, his face the color of ashes. </p>

			<p> He saw a contraption that looked like a radar dish, hidden in a corner on this side of the street. Arvardan knew exactly what this was. It was what he had been designing the software for: the new, high-powered, active Listener. The device was capable of sending out active electromagnetic waves to capture vibrations made by voices against walls and windows from a distance, and examine such speech for sensitive words. </p>

			<p> If such a device had been installed right near Artemis's home, then that meant the Talking Club was completely exposed to the view of the appropriate authorities. The active Listener's penetrating waves would easily pierce through the lead curtains, and transmit the Club members' words verbatim to the ears of the appropriate authorities. </p>

			<p> This invention defined a new era. The appropriate authorities no longer had to wait passively for warnings. Instead, they could at any time actively inspect any speech made by anyone. Arvardan could easily imagine what had happened next. Everything that Artemis and the others said was recorded by the appropriate authorities. Then the police broke into her apartment and arrested all the members of the Talking Club who were present. After they conducted a search, all that was left was the empty room and the empty windows. </p>

			<p> Arvardan felt a knife was being twisted in his heart. He did not think that he was fortunate to have escaped capture. His stomach churned, and nausea rose from his stomach to his mouth. He wanted to vomit, but he couldn't-"vomit" was itself a sensitive word. His body, only just recovered, could not take the hit. He began to shake as though he was suffering chills. </p>

			<p> He dared not continue forward. He turned around, boarded another bus, and shut his mouth even tighter. When Arvardan returned to his own building, he saw that another active Listener was being installed nearby. The dark antenna extended into the sky, and along with the other antennas around the Capital, it wove an invisible, giant Web in the sky that covered everything. </p>

			<p> He dared not stop to look. Keeping his head low, he walked past the active Listener, and returned home without stopping. Then he hid his face in the pillow, but dared not cry out loud. He couldn't even say, "Fuck you, you sonovabitch." </p>

			<p> After that, Arvardan's life returned to normal-just like before, it was stagnant, restrained, passionless, healthy, and without any vulgar joys. Lancelot had said that the result of the war was that the people's desire for freedom would push language to the edge of death. The death of the Talking Club led to the deletion of "talking," "opera," "frank," and "exchange" from the List of Healthy Words. </p>

			<p> Although it was still possible to use numbers, the number "1984" was shielded. One morning, without any warning, Arvardan was simply assigned a new Web Access Serial that no longer contained that string of numerals. This also meant that programmers like Arvardan had to constantly ensure that their programs did not compute illegal numbers. This added greatly to the workload, and Arvardan was even more exhausted. </p>

			<p> What happened later in Nineteen Eighty-Four Arvardan would never know. Duras, the only one who did know, had disappeared completely. So what happened to Winston and Julia would forever be a mystery: like the fate of Lancelot, Wagner, Duras, and Artemis. </p>

			<p> He worried the most about Artemis. Every time he thought of that name, Arvardan could not control how depressed he became. What happened to her? Was she completely shielded? If that was the case, then the only trace she left in this world would be a pseudonym in the memory of a programmer. </p>

			<p> Three weeks after the disappearance of the Talking Club, everything remained calm. No one came after Arvardan. He thought maybe it was because the others had refused to give up any information about him. Or maybe it was because they didn't really know who he was-the person they knew was a programmer named Wang Er. In the Capital there were thousands of programmers, and Wang Er was just a pseudonym. </p>

			<p> Life went on peacefully. No, to be precise, there was one bit of difference. That would be the List of Healthy Words: words disappeared from it at a faster and faster pace. Every hour, every minute, words vanished from it. As the pace of revision for the List quickened, emails and BBS forum posts became more and more vapid and banal. Since people had to use an extremely limited set of words to express an inexpressibly wide range of thoughts, everyone more and more preferred silence. Even the secret codes and hidden clues became fewer. </p>

			<p> One day, Arvardan lifted his head from the computer. He stared at the grey, hazy sky outside the window, and his chest spasmed. He coughed in pain, and drained the distilled water from his cup. He threw the disposable plastic cup into the trashcan, also made of plastic. Listening to the dull sound of plastic hitting plastic, he thought his own brain was also filled with a pile of trash. He rapped his knuckles against his skull. Indeed, the same empty dull sound came out. </p>

			<p> He put on his coat and filtering mask and walked out the door. He did not wear a portable Listener because it was no longer necessary. The Capital was filled with active Listeners, ever vigilant for the presence of sensitive words. The entire Capital now was just like the Web, healthy and stable. </p>

			<p> Arvardan had a legitimate excuse for going outside. He had decided to turn in his permit for BBS service. It was no longer necessary to use this service. Email, BBS forums, Web sites-everything was now the same. </p>

			<p> The calendar said it was spring, but outside it was still very cold. Tall, grey buildings stood like a forest of stone in absolute zero. Gusts of wind carrying yellow sand and polluting exhaust gas rushed between them and filled every available space, making it impossible for anyone to escape their suffocating presence. Arvardan put his hands in his pockets, shrank into his coat, and continued to the building for the Department of Web Security. </p>

			<p> Suddenly, he stopped, his feet frozen in place, incapable of movement. He saw Artemis, standing under the street light before him and wearing a black uniform. But what a change had come over her! She seemed at least ten years older, her face full of wrinkles. There was none of the vitality of youth left in her. She heard his steps, turned around, and her dark eyes seemed especially empty. She stared past Arvardan into the distance, without focus. </p>

			<p> Arvardan had never expected to meet her at this time in this place. His heart, long dormant, now was lit by a few sparks. But his dull and exhausted nerves were incapable of feeling the simple emotion of "excitement." The two stared at each other for a while. He finally walked next to her, and tentatively moved his lips, as though he wanted to say something to her. But when he took out the latest edition of the List of Healthy Words distributed earlier that day, he found it was empty-even the last word had been shielded by the appropriate authorities. </p>

			<p> An address flashed in his mind-luckily, it was not yet possible to shield the mind with technology. Perhaps it was now time to take a trip to the mountains. He had nothing more to lose. </p>

			<p> Someone has to do this. </p>

			<p> And so, Arvardan maintained his silence. He passed by the expressionless Artemis, and continued his forward progress. His silhouette eventually melted into the equally quiet, grey crowd. </p>

			<p> The whole city seemed especially silent. </p>
